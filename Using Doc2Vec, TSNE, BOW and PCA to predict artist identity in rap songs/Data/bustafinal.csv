Daddy, what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?
Well sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream.
But I'm afraid the end time is near
The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind
It will be an Era fraught with boundless greed & corruption
Where global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice
The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins
Un-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted
Left to bake in the searing naked rays of light
Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government
Leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves
Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok
Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out
Unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust
Annihilating the terrified masses
Leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers
Begged on revenge, but against whom?
There are so few left alive
Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path
Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell
Causing unending volcanic eruptions
The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison
Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure
Laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers
Fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains
This is, Extinction Level Event
The Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left
Wow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!
You don't have to, because here it is

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Callin' all live niggas
Callin' all live bitches

Uh, my interruption, cause a major concussion
Dome piece swollen, son you need a cup of Bufferin'
Peep my post-production, (Hey!), follow my instruction
Bounce back, my repercussion cause mass destruction
Fuck around strain ya, 'til ya plan malfunction
Sit cha ass down, (Hey!), bouncin' out ta Flushin (Queens, NYC)
Check extra P, by the boom weed, from a Russian
I remember, when I used ta rhyme, for next to nothin'
I got so much ta offer, every time I tell you somethin'
(Hey!) I'm about ta drop it! (Who?) you could never stop it
Let me quickly chop it, still, a lot of niggas -
Idolize the false prophet, the rhyming Lou Gossett
Hold your head and shoulders, yo I roll with evil holders
Dealin with the facts, I hold the science in the folders
The jewel, on how to knock you from concussion, into comas
Test shit, I pull your valve from out your breast kid
Mess with, shit like this, after God blessed it

Uh, I'm bout to cause chaos, steady bustin ya bra's
Switch to witch craft, my chemistry witcha séance
Fuck the bullshit, livin' in the zone of my renaissance
My squad stay formin', like the Muslims down at the Mosque
Split ya fuckin frame, like we raisin splittin' cigars
I be workin' wonders, my squad formin' numbers
Christopher Columbus? Discover how yo' speed
Got swell up like cucumbers, my name be rollin' thunders
My degrees multiply the heat, more this summer
My flows got so much rhythm, substitute the drummer
Yo fuck that, focusin' about the front runner
Who you think you is? You better stay protected -
Walkin' out the door, makin' sure you rock the double breasted
Fuckin' with them devils, watch your soul get recollected
Motherfuckin' shame when you (DIE!) disrespected
Every bitch nigga in the world, should be arrested
Beat with many strikes, until their train of thought is redirected
The wrong has been corrected, (GOD!) has been elected
The squad has come to rule us, with the jewels manifested
Extreme, my thought process on every record
Blow the spots to pieces bounce, without a clue right through the exit

[Chorus]
The whole world lookin' at me (yeah, I feel so good)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so supreme)
The whole world lookin' at me (imperial)

If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so supreme)
The whole world lookin' at me (imperial)
Watchin' and waitin' to see
If I fulfill my destiny (I feel so high)
The whole world lookin' at me (so high in the sky)
Watchin' and waitin' to see

And while your style will soften, my mind will drift often
To illusions of my lyrics given you massages in the coffin

A lot of bitch rich niggas experience extortion
Since I was born when I perform, I drop a million
And one stony rocks on niggas like a fuckin hailstorm
I pollute yo, my new flow, put on your funeral home suit
And execute 'em with a bang (shoot)
The blow torch has been ignited, those who so excited, ha
I'm bout to rope 'em in, a bunch of bitch niggas are being extradited
You soundin' so sloppy, like a broken muffler draggin behind, an old jalopy
Once the bomb drops, here's the aftermath
Scientists tried to dissect the way, I formulate my craft
Worrying 'bout how I achieve things
The way I analyze shit and how I percieve things
My style is real, like lamb skin imported from the Persian
Follow my excursion, all the way 'til you feelin' the new revised version
I complete then I defeat, destroy who ever complicate
How I eat, survival hungry nigga

Ridin dirty, and bustin like thirty-thirty, til a nigga end
Knowin that the shit is fucked I'm still here to win (what?)
Cheddar (uh) if you ain't about it then I think you better
Hang the little plot you got, don't sweat it main
My nigga, my life's uncut like Kane, real raw
Y'all don't know shit about Jamal or what I'm in it for:
Cash, cars, fly whores and tours
Fillin my pipe, with no messes and no limits
Them other one scrimpin, has the tent froze frigid
Fraud as a gimmick, dick lickin chasin chickens
I mash for the cash with the click and
Rip a show then I'm dippin in the whip and high trippin

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
While y'all niggas hoppin and skippin I stick the clip in, yo
Accelerate on the gas, move fast
Blast, find a nigga FOOT in your ass
Colorful niggas, just peep the whole contrast
Flipmode is the Squad, a news flash
Bust your shit up, what the fuck, nigga get up
Violate, niggas get they whole SHIT lit up!
Break fool, niggas know the rules, rob jewels
Champagne bath, throw the Moet in the pool
Nigga caught a motherfuckin strain on the brain
Ridin on the train, I'mma whip a Benz in the rain
Oversized click on the rise so realize we be
Dem niggas that dead up all you funny little small fries
The franchise, Flipmode damagin all of you fall guys
Yo I'm tired of niggas they full of true lies
No time.. we got the right surprise
Need a new beginnin, need to get a baptise
Ha ha, you need to get a baptise
Word is bond, aiyyo

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Not a problem my squad can't fix
'Cause we can do, it in the mix
So when you niggas talk trash, you can get a bust ass
'Cause you know we don't fuck around
When you niggas talk shit, lay ya six feet under the ground
Ground ground, ground ground
When you niggas talk shit, lay ya six feet under the ground
Ground ground, ground ground

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ground, a-ground, a-gr-gr-ground-ground

Flipmode is da Squad so it's no surprise
Niggas want to advertise about how we get down
You fuck around: leave your body in the lost and found
How you like me now?
We got the industry on lock
The world is on shock

Yo, you feel it in the heart when we took you to the park
Midnight after dark, I'm the raider of the lost ark (ark echo's)

[Verse 2: Serious]
Now na na na na na na, na na nah
Super size, super size, right before your eyes

Killing all the tips from studio spies
Head to bed, beddie bye, beddie bye
Don't ask why. Why? What do you ask as a reply?
Flipmode's the Squad don't rest, don't try
Peace to my people in the friendly sky
Peace to my outer space ties

Pick up the cain no more
Brothers ain't the same no more
Try to sweat me, what am I aiming for
Get yourself caught up

In the worst way, the only way you can stop me

Nigga fragile let his brain fry
Pretty boy sliced up feel the contact from this red eye
You failed to realize when you macks me you drop the plastic
Run up in your crib and snatch the heemis from the mattress
My crew expanded, QB is where we landed
Yellow strip you crossed it
Now I'm forcing you to drink this Sham's potion
Show me were loaded

Reminisce the promise
Bring drama like Nicaragua
Fatigues march, army leaders, they count crooked drug dollars
And sip fresh squeezed milk from the titties of llamas
Leave cities in carnage
Pretty as farmers that pour whiskey at harvest and hold 16 bananas
Maintain, maintain, maintain
I reign like Mussolini's iron fists
Try on this, you can't see me like vagina lips
Smugglin diamond chips, bubblin anonymous
The dominant will resource and count on script crews and world wars

Never interfere and shit, souvenirs for your ears and shit
Clear poetry like William Shakespeare and shit

You lost and you walkin about
Niggas got beef they really want to chill and start talkin it out
Hey, oh my god, y'all nigga be buggin me out
Wish they could lay me down and have the police start chalkin me out

BLAOW!! You better park, niggas I spark
Niggas like sharp niggas I stay up rippin shit apart
Niggas float over water like Noah's Ark, niggas cover yo' face!
And don't get caught up in the scene when it get dark niggas
UHH, excuses me Mrs.! Sure to hit you with the fitness
Give you niggas the sickest, jumpin Jehovah Witness
Beamin in on niggas plottin and schemin
And steady dreamin on how they gon' do they double-teamin..
Fuck the bullshit, my nigga it be best you know 'bout it
Before you get secret indicted, make me SLAP a nigga lopsided!
Hold up, son listen it be so beautiful
When we catch you like a nigga sold us too much pharmaceuticals!

That's my words on Mrs. Mahalia
I hope you know yo' best bet, is to get the FUCK out of my area
Before I rip you from out yo' interior
And hope you know you got to keep a corny nigga smothered
Grab the gat off the cupboard
You never know when shit is safe so keep yo' face covered!
While I be scorchin it, a lot of niggas be lookin for alternates
And still just lose they life that's so unfortunate
Trailblazin me, since my mother started raisin me
Hit you with the powerful shit that sometimes amazes me

Catchin suspects who thinkin they SO lucky

The way it happened son, you'd never figure
How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger

Getting paid for even if we robbing a fucking chickenhead
Word to mother son, I ain't fronting
I'm taking everything I been always wanting
So I continue to peep out, in the jam will be the most blidded
Rob 'em in the corner bounce to the bar with they money and buy drinks with

Knife shit

Leaving niggas ass naked
Sometime I know it seems so shocking
How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace
And if you thinking that's strong
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around
You feel the full five long
The victim contemplating what to do
Or how the fuck top get out of the situation that he's going through

Bet y'all niggas wanna know how the rest of the story happened...

Smoke my la la out in LA, who's ready
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy
See Angelettie when a nigga need his chedd-ay
Cause I'm rawer than a broad way
With all A's and platinum
There been many things we touch
Never had a partner so I never had to deduct shit 1.8
And every week I have to re-up
So what, so what

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Ay yo, check out the way me and my niggas always be rippin' shit
The way that I display new flavor and do it so intricate
Pitter and patter, patter and pitter all over this shit
Uh uh uh oh, y'all niggas be yappin' till I be sick of it
Hit you with shit that y'all niggas will never ever forget
Fuckin' with my niggas is like you playin' Russian Roulette
Ooh me and my whole platoon coming soon
Nigga make room, we diesel like a bunch of baboons
Hey yo yo, think you can manage all of my niggas damage?
Tryin' to alter our lavish livin' niggas will turn savage
Yo Flipmode and Bad Boy collabo'
Makin' sure all of you niggas all say, “Hoooo!”

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
To my people in the front, if you ready to bump, say
""Don't stop the body rock""
To my people in the back, if you're not a wack, say

Lord Have Mercy, Busta Rhymes, Flipmode Trilogy

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, we ain't familiar at all, nigga
Don't like it? Go grab your gat and lets brawl at hall, nigga
Straight fallin', when we use to chill up on park benches
My twenty block radius, think we need some barb wire fences
Stop bitch niggas, like you from easily trespassing
Nickel-nine , shine on your eye, then you see fire blastin'
Get off my premises, aye yo, Lord, is you a friend of his?
Mouth him back to John and show this nigga, just who the winner is
The presence of a small town, I diminish and blemishes
I'ma play ya ass out like a game on my little Sega Genesis
This inappropriate, fuck is we talkin' for when we ain't even associates?
Ass lyrical beatings, straight trick or treating
What ya eatin
I ain't got no words for you
Fuck speakinm ain't part of my crew
Face look to brand new, who?
Niggas ain't even aloud to send my pass through
Can't chill on corner can't go up in my bodega
Chill before I call Dinco to grab the quatro-cinco
We don't give a fuck right now
We be hi caliber shit
Ya'll corny niggas must bow
We do unforgivable shit
We blow the spot any how, move
Ready for battle cause I'm refusin to lose
I'mma beat ya ass in front of nobody with nuthin to prove
Live nigga shit right there
Beware, stand clear
None-a-y'all niggas is welcome here

[Chorus]
Fuck is these niggas son
Get off my block
Yo I don't know none of these niggas du
Get off my block
Them niggas wanna sell there weed here
Get off my block
Yo who these unfamiliar corn balls
Get off my block
Let’s run these niggas off my street corner
Get off my block

[Verse 2: Lord Have Mercy]
Now who the fuck you beeeeee? Landlord
Cradle la stainless for strangers
Vigilante, trigga stampedes
On the bulletproof hooded crews
That lade this nigga ta hand breath
Move you off the block
The unorthodox general
Flash flood when a crowd
Patriotic for the intrepid style and wreck more kids than pedophiles
Niggaaaaaaa, for ever trapped in danger
Emaciate when I take my razor
Sharp heards that scare herds
Niggaaaaa, I'm from the wicked city
When chickens twist trees and dick tease
Breast feed, Betsy's with asthmatic chest wheeze
Lord Have, cardiac arrest freeze
Please, bastard handicap crews that stay soft
It's mayor, Adolf
School your army, ya squad weak
Remove four camps when I say
Pumpin arms like nor plants
I conquer and hold
Home sweet home down with monster control
Still we in the cut like Ron and Nicole
And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Blind feelin nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
Con scrimmage, woke up Allah's children
Dirty-ass Vietnam village
I finish and outsuns
Then fold, like Minister Malcolm at the venetian blinds
By all means necessary I reach for mine and
Lift golden showers from roof tops
And give orders, rugged pound acre
Drown violators in buckets of piss water

[Chorus]
Fuck is these niggas son
Get off my block
Yo I don't know none of these niggas du
Get off my block
Them niggas wanna sell there weed here
Get off my block

[Verse]
Though some of us have been poisoned
Many of us have been blessed
And through the worst shit
That we all as people go through
Every blessing that we are blessed to have
Are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
And makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
Everything and every motherfucker gets dealt with accordingly
Mark my words
See I remember on The Coming album
You know when there was only five years left
It was once said that there was no time
To take time for granted
Well we are now face to face with that very given time
There's only one year left motherfuckers
1999
The dawn of the new millennium
I understand though
Sometimes it takes time
And hands-on extreme hardship experience
To realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
By all means
It will always be better to be safe than to be sorry
So as we finally approach the year 2000
Behold what it might have in store for us people
There have been many indications of changes
That will occur, that has already occurred
That were not and will not be set up to our benefit, as people
But in order for us to continue to build
We must destroy
And unfortunately in the process
Many of us will be liable candidates
Of being destroyed
But in the bigger scheme of things we must defend
What we all collectively identify with as the truth
And with what is right
To all my live soldiers
And all my live women
Those who may not survive the turning point
May you forever rest peacefully
As you are delivered back to the essence
So I dedicate this burial song to all of you
To my survival of the most fit for real niggas
And women no doubt
Continue to get what's yours from out this fucker
Before your time run out
And may the force of survival forever rest with y'all
My live motherfuckers
To all my survivalists
See you in the next thousand year period
Allah bless all y'all
Flipmode continue to bounce
Like a satellite in orbit
Seein' all you motherfuckers at every angle
The imperial, the universal, powerful Flipmode squad
Stay tuned
See y'all motherfuckers, January 1st 2000

Bang you on your head so hard, shit be formin callouses

[Chorus]
Watch me get down and just do my thing baby

[Verse 2]
When I step in the place you should keep your mouth closed
Take your fat finger out your nose
You should just pay attention, and watch how I wild on records
Make you sing, ""The Lord is my shepherd!""
In the process I do away with all nonsense
Hit you with magic like my name was Pocahontas
The dread, gon' make you party til you dead
Niggas quick to talk shit.. OOPS! Upside your head
Put your head to bed -- let me do my thing -- nuff said
Shit so hot make your chickenhead do the spread
Tell me what you said -- I said I never leave you misled
While you bullshit, I'd rather get the lucci instead
Hah-huh-hah-hee-hah! Flip until you fall
Whylin in your whip, til you crash into a brick wall
Through the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless
Always blowin up your spot, bringin more surprises
You, you know you really need to come clean
Let me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene
I will endanger your species like an ostrich
Hold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage
HAH! I be the number one chosen just to keep you open
Chill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen
Pay the prices made the needed sacrifices
To present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises

Watch me get down and just do my thing baby

So—

[Verse 1]
Yo, y'all (y'all) one more time I come
Knucklehead flow that make you act real dumb
Yo (yo), I burn your food like Florence
Run up in your crib like my name was search warrants
Shut your mouth, nigga—don't you complain
Fix you up, mix you with cut like pro-caines
Oh! Insane to your brain
Right on your subconscious, I leave my shit stain
I be the mostest with rhyme overdoses
Hot stepping over shit like Ini Kamoze's
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus, while I display flows ferocious
Weak niggas just fall and keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like I'm hand to hand herb hustling
Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw
Fuck what you heard, you ain't heard this before

I make sure everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw

[Verse 2]
Yo—when I step in the place I leave damages
'nuff bandages on pussy from miscarriages
Yo—watch me bring the newest recipe
Fuck you up quick and condemn you all with leprosy
Let me hit you with flows, that come various
(Hah) send you home and make you lie bout your alias
(Ha-ha) niggas can't see my routine
When I round up my Flipmode niggas and get cream
Hey, you! You know what the fuck I mean
Now I'm on the scene, stepping through like Mean Joe Green
Now I'm making you feel the extreme
Till I black you out then turn on my real high beam
Oh shit, now I got your brains fried
Once you inhale smoke from my flow, carbon monoxide!
Use your imagination, let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes, Earth Wind & Fire
Yo, hit the dirt, get on the floor
I'm that outlaw nigga living right next door
You should just roll out the red carpet
All movin' targets, I got you open like supermarkets
Yo yo—there's only five years left
While niggas is scared to death they breathe they last breath
Days of my life goes on, word is bond
I make you feel my proton, neutron, and electron
Yo, I be the number one icon
Word to the holy Qu'ran, I rock on and on
On and on, hey, on and on and on
You won't understand when I form Voltron

[Chorus]
Hahahaha—everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw

Been in the game, since the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm gonna see my P.O
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like Neo Geo (Hahahaaa)
I always roam through the forest just like a brontosaurus
Born in the month of May so my sign is Taurus
Kick you in your face like my fuckin' name was Chuck Norris
Make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless
Many niggas wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm gettin' phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flipmode clique
The way we get down and bust niggas shit
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoke and...
People always askin' me, how your shit be sellin'
For makin' shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin' melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no tellin', when I would strike and had you swellin'
Cruisin' in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin'
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin'
Yo, fuck that! You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin'
If you ain't makin' noise you need to kill the fuckin' yellin'

I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
You're lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin' five in The Source

Turn and toss, niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin' Hugo Boss
Ayo Bussa Bus (What?) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J
Now I'm writin' rhymes hittin' shorties every day
In the full runnin' drinkin' ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fillet
Now I'm knockin' out niggas from ... to ... touche!
Now I'm goin' back around the way
I'm rippin' shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye
Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggas open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo, I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins (Margins)
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin' (Yah)
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin'
Now your shit is done like a fuckin' empty milk carton
It's on for the 9-6, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Vicks
Stickin' to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated .44
All my rough niggas open the do'
'Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'
Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Every time I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breakin' fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Ayyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan
Singin' at your funeral like Bobby ""Blue"" Bland

Complicate your vision and make the world look strange

Drip from the top of your lip - losing concentration
Don't you try to front like we got some type affiliation
Bought yourself a piece you shit to try and avoid the confrontation
Fear me, it's in your bloodstream feel the circulation
Permanently trife and affecting life like immunization
Oh shit, I've got you feeling nervous on purpose (Ha!)
I love bring that shit right at you - door to door service
Instantaneous, you will still get your shit bust (Bust)
Only spontaneous, all that shit talk is miscellaneous

Aeiyo, I'm in this to win this, gets down to handle my buisiness
While I be Busta Rhymes you still be whoever your name is
In my past life the world felt my mega blast
Now in my present life I'mma still bust your fucking ass
Yo, it's been predicted, ever since I was a child
Getting addicted to candy bars I was still wicked
Drop jewels on many fools while my niggas pack tools
In '89 when we signed this Leaders Of The New School
Four, lyrical Schwarzeneggers rolling like commanders
Wrecking shit, hit after hit, while we set the standards
Back then came leaders of the 'New it was like a dream come true
You could scream on the mic and do what you gotta do
In the meantime I show improved and stick my lagoon theory
Scream at the top of my lungs until you fuckers hear me

My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funkmaster Flex say 'Yo, I'm feeling these'
Flows make you shit in your drawers. Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's
Ass constipated... too much extra cheese
But anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese
Lesbians with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees

I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain’t nothin' sweet, on the street, for good deeds I compete
Come on complete, and unique, so get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff lah
Positive to comply
Don’t screw face and act rah
Progress, don't fall back. We can't have that
I'll hold your hand, Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward as I play this life
'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife
In the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize
Logic-a-lly thinking when along's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we fab
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blaow!
No, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo, why's that?
Amalgamate, so we can get these ends
Yo, true that

Daddy, what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?
Well sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream.
But I'm afraid the end time is near
The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind
It will be an Era fraught with boundless greed & corruption
Where global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice
The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins
Un-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted
Left to bake in the searing naked rays of light
Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government
Leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves
Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok
Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out
Unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust
Annihilating the terrified masses
Leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers
Begged on revenge, but against whom?
There are so few left alive
Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path
Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell
Causing unending volcanic eruptions
The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison
Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure
Laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers
Fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains
This is, Extinction Level Event
The Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left
Wow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!
You don't have to, because here it is

I want you to cum all over me, and when you do, I'll bathe you. And then we'll get out the tub, and we'll fuck, and I'll lick your ass, and I'll braid your hair, and you can fuck me anyway you please. We can do almost anything, but once we're finished, and you're happy here, you have to go back home to your wife. But don't you ever forget that I'm your wife in law...

This nigga was eagerly waitin to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancin to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly poppin shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talkin his shit we watched the sky gettin dark - he said

Well isn't you (?) where it hurts, I'll leave you in a rock sample
Straight up leakin in the back of a church
Then I ghost ya crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leavin you old and decrepit like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your ashes to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes

And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house

Tell me how the FUCK a nigga really end up havin beef with the devil
Shit bugged the whole effect the nigga had on my dreamin
Body reactin mentally, goin to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like a typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watchin my body twitch funny and shit
Givin shorty sleepin with me the creeps
She buggin off how a nigga just sweatin and breathin so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killin the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect durin the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
Inhale a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leavin a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassemblin now
Simultaneous wifey watchin a nigga body tremblin now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbed a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo it's funny how the devils'll test us
But it's only select, niggas blessed with somethin so miraculous and precious
Til I'm dead I'm always battlin through
You disbelieve then cut my main vein that all my blood be travelin through
Somebody got to die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death
I'm ready for WAR!!!!!!

Party over here, ain't shit over there!

See how I'm drillin 'em baby?
It's Bus-a-Bus back bitch, I'm killin 'em crazy
We off the Relaxic, I'm spillin the gravy
Got every club packed thick, creating a frenzy
To be the latest greatest for all you niggas from gazing
Bugatti off white tan, interior pastry
See my swagger sharp like that, these niggas amaze me
As a matter a fact just salute me and praise me
Enough of that

We be up in the club, niggas sportin them minks
Tipsy in the club, nigga buyin 'em drinks
Walk around lookin like our shit don't stink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink

[Busta Rhymes]
Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up and I'm lovin ya hairdo
The way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checkin for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to

Switched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut
Shorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up
I love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up
It's gettin hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up
Amazed by the pinky, neck, and wrist be gleaming up
How I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up
I see you liking everything, you see me and you
You frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo
The hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you
Ya girl looking like she wit' it, she can come/cum get it too
You get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move

Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do'
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from

[Busta Rhymes]
My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin
Blendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it
In other words I

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin into shit
Like we innocent, actin older than we should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
It's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}

You know, my homey Treach from Naughty By Nature once said
If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fucking ghetto
But I'mma let one of our most immaculate tour guides
Take us all through the ghetto - my nigga Rick James!

[Rick James - sampled from ""Ghetto Life""] + (backup singers)
When I was a young boy, growing up in the ghetto!
Hanging out on corners, singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks, trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)
(Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

Hustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothing like the hood nigga, I don't care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

You'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)

Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people, I love that!

Wit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama
Strike like a brightness, a light.. I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya

Now I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal, ridin' through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seein' when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, struttin' in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret it because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise

Like sleepin under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin' up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murciélago, ghostin' them narcos
Toastin' the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent

Watch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot

Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love totin the Glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks

They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me

Cause you see how this money can change everything

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Geah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Muhfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggas, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggas, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
Behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, your peeps be leaving you speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me

Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
How niggas steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
Niggas was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill my brother every time them fuckers betray me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt

Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggas busy tryna fuck with my bitch
Same niggas spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggas, that'll owe me so much shit
That they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggas get, shit around you will change
Even though niggas'll flip and say, ""You the one changed""
Fuck you, they do that just to justify takin your shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!

That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention

And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you

While I figure it out and sort what I'm tryin to say, let's walk
Just tryin to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feelin somethin special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm tryin to score with you

Is it somethin at all or did I just bump in and fall

But it's nothin to crawl before we walk (OOH) listen
And it's nothin to stall before we talk - look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm diggin you, I ain't just tryin to pound you
I'm only tryin to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
Just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine

As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin on to them days when everything was about you
But niggas don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin
You doin shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin in

Dad: Well sweetheart for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream. But I'm afraid the end time is near. The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind. It will be an era fraught with boundless greed & corruption where global monetary systems disintegrate leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of over cooked rice
The nations of the civilised world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens. Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins. Unshielded by the O-zone they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the searing naked rays of light
Wholesale assassinations served to destabilise every remaining government, leaving the starving & wicked to fend For themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax dodging corporations reek havoc. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total world wide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the terrified masses, leaving in its Torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutating, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers, begged on revenge, but against whom? There are so few left alive
Starvation reins supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path. Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow egg shell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. Creatures of the seven seas Unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison
Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains
This is Extinction Level Event

The more the heavy, the more the solid, my niggas run thick
Fast to bap the John type, my niggas murder you quick
Yo, take it easy while back at the ranch
You talk too much you get beat with a tree branch
The most influential, whether in projects or suburban residential, fuck that
We keep the livest niggas happy then we blow the spot quick
Give me money make it snappy
Oh my God, Flipmode is the Squidaud
It's war if you dare step foot in my yard
My protocol is to create
Substances abuse lyrics like alcohol
Nigga try to recall
When I hit you, you ain't even know that you was gon' fall
Cut your shit up, turned around and bumped your head and all
Leapin' lizard
Always remain grand wizard
Fuck around and sleep, nigga, you get caught up in my blizzard
Askin' who is it
My niggas ain't around, I ain't with it
Ayo, yo yo yo
We here to stay fuck payin' a visit
So consistent, demand everybody's assistant
Let us reach for all things without any resistance
Fatality, for all those in the world that might be mad at me
Suffer in the faces of my immortality
To the one who didn't make it

[Chorus]
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it
Take it....",eastcoast

Extinction Level Event shit
Bomb threat to the whole world
What what what is goin' on?
What the fuck goin' on here? Check it out yo

[Verse 1]
Holy amazing grace about face
Total erase you niggas off the face of the place
Such a shame I had to go grab my calico
Pass the dough 'fore you find out what I had to blast you fo'
Extreme laws for ones who did try to go against this
Wet your shit up like a sloppy tongue kiss
Wait, but wait, you, who don't know what you talkin' about
Without a doubt, where my live niggas? Give me a shout!
Yo, yo-yo, yo, on the strength shit niggas check fo'
Connect the four shots and guess who blew it from next door
Bling, time after time we gon' shine again
Feel it like a broad getting fucked from behind again
Ayo, ayo I be the closest thing to the next
Like the pain and sufferin' of about a million deaths
I'm only here to present and bring the impact
Of the Extinction Level Event, now sing the song of salvation

La la, la la la, la la

[Verse 2]
Yo yo yo, disregard your whole assignment
Crooked ass nigga need some realignment, powerful refinement
Crazy shit I do make me wanna know where my mind went
Blackin' out, buildin' hostility, gettin' violent
Straight giving niggas an ass-whippin' on consignment
Then I bust your shit 'til the day of my whole retirement
Yo, yo, shake it and rattle like we ready to battle
Fight seein' at every angle like a motherfucking satellite
Quickly bust up your crotches and fuck up your process
Bounce in the night, leavin' sayin' ""Adios"" or even ""Buenas noches""
Have y'all niggas wildin', havin' a fit
Flame throwin' lyrics like a bunch of blowtorches and shit
Grand spectacular, chainsaw massacre
Thug fanatic street shit that be on the creep comin' after ya
Then we hit you with the most significant time bomb
Ready to designate at the slightest wave of a white arm
Best form of advice I could give is remain calm
The repercussion is somethin' you could never imagine would be goin' on
(HA!) Never believe in your eyes
When my Squad some through at an astronomically large size
Movin the mountains keepin' all of my niggas bouncin'
Big up my bitches in the place who be screamin' and shoutin'
(HA!) I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event
Sing the song of salvation

Bounce nigga bounce bounce bounce nigga bounce bounce
When I come through, hit y'all with the one, two
Break y'all niggas that y'all niggas won't even know what to do
Break fool, make all y'all people wanna come to
Feel the force of my shit kickin' like it was Kung Fu
Blast through, don't these corny niggas harass you
Set a tone in the streets where even the fans blast you
Ask you niggas, do y'all really want the brand new?
Corny niggas just finish your time and over, passed due
Hee, ha, what ho, think it's way passed your curfew
Hit you with some shit that make doctors come have to nurse you, you, you, you
I'm rollin' with my whole crew
Bounce through you niggas whenever we surround you
Flipmode roll thick, and you know we don't wait
Hit you with some more hits that make y'all wanna go shit, shit, shit
Yo, make y'all niggas jump back
Hit that, hurry and pass the rest of the weed black

One more time I hit y'all with a crime
While I be in my rhyme I hear that a drop of a dime
Wildin' all in my Tim boots
Now we stackin' mad loot
Everybody holdin' and 21 gun, salute
Anyway any how, I'ma give it to you now
You ain't wildin' my nigga, that is something I won't allow
One two three four, I be knockin' at your door
Hit y'all niggas with an effect that y'all never felt before
Or leave you with somemore freaky dicky metaphor
Rep for all my niggas who stay reppin' the hardcore
Slug it out, bugging out, all off my niggas thug it out
Tired of all these weak niggas now I'ma rub you out
Yo, what you talkin' 'bout, make y'all niggas scream and shout
Yo, we bout to blast you out the spot my nigga no doubt, doubt, doubt, doubt
Yo, you know we always stay on
Keep wildin' before you know it the entire day is gone
Left, right, left, yo, no need to hold your breath
Yo, better chill your body up while we beat you to death, death, death, death, death
Blast you right through your chest
Yo, you know we runnin' shit and we never settle for less, yo

Rep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off

Ay look, the cowboy ain't wanna meet (meat) on URL
So Rare Breed was the medium to cater the plate
This beef 'bout to get done well
Y'all 'bout to see the vegan done made a mistake (made him a steak)
Do him greasy, finger lickin', savor the taste
Talkin' Beasley, SMACK niggas, stay in ya place
You get shot in ya face, and then shot in ya face more
They say, ""Mook you went overboard.""
Of course, that's how you make sure (shore)
Let's pick up the pace
Chase gave a nigga from the Lou' the baton
Well I got him, no problem
It's gonna look like the bottoms after I stomp blood out him
Mr. Easy Bucket stupid, this feat (feet) you in
A Christian Lou' been (Loubin') for the win, I'ma shoo (shoe) in
And guess who doin' the bap, bap, bap ties and the gat risin'
They all come my way with detention
End up gettin' the same sentence
Start with I, chalk lines, mad times, I show 'em the ropes
Now this is where Chaz ties in (chastising)
If I don't put Chaz man in a casket
Shiiit, you gon' be nappin' on a mattress
With a permanent address at the hospital
The sight gon' be the saddest, it's tragic
Imagine havin' to see ya kid try to play peek a boo witchu in ICU (and I see you)
I can see more wrong (moron) when I see you
God got a devilish sense of humor, that's probably true
I mean his test gotta be a few of the funniest jokes
Like, ""Don't y'all think it's hilarious that after you just decided to stop eatin' meat, that man put you right in front of the GOAT.""
Here this guy go (Geico), ""Mook ain't got bars, he just be talkin', he borin'.""
I'm ensurin' (insuring) that's one of your quotes
Well if Progressive punchlines whatchu want, fine
But you better hold that same fuckin' policy for your rhymes
I'm 'bout to have each and everyone behind you mournin' (morning), sunshine
The stream ran I'm a heavy fav'
So much damn (dam) damage the levees break
Me, I championed every weight
Light weight to heavy weight
Every class that was dealt, blood let's demonstrate
Pussy I got it locked and I ain't never introducin' Chaz to these (chastity) belts
This a case of mistaken identity, ARP givin' me the wrong person
For him remember, these jail bars wasn't meant for
So in a sense (innocence) it'll be, now you can't bail 'cause you don't know the shit you in for
This your day to loss (data loss), backup everything like when you send off your phone the Sprint store
'Cause if boy can't walkie what he talkie
Well that's the kinda shit I give you 10 for (10-4)
*ch-ch* ""Man down""
It was Math Hoffa who wanted this fuckin' loss
But me and Math campaign (cam' pain) don't add up for promo
I don't care what it cost
Now here's news for you Verb
If I'm puzzled by your words, then the lead put you right in the box
Straight up and down, I ain't the one to cross
This .40 kick back hard as a fuckin' horse
Push ya shit back like, ""Huh, I think this one is yours.""
Or I lift a rusty brown .44

{Aye Verb finally has enough of Mook poking and pushing him and a fight breaks out}

Push ya shit back like, ""Huh, I think this one is yours.""
Or I lift a rusty brown .44
Empty three (MP3), Verb see these (CD's) ain't around no more
I planned your Geronimo a long time ago
Clumsy nigga, fell for it though
The ho thought he caught the drop
But the grip is like a whip without standin' tickets, I keep it on the lot (on a lot)
Picture me debatin' with the haters about the greatest names is, ""What four?""
What for? When the last time you saw a picture of God carved on Mt. Rushmore?
Huh, huh, huh, uh? Mr. Important Number, you recall
How I did the Jewish boy
When Mook awarded […] that shit was Biblical
Now he worshipin' me with his gefilte fish
Man listen, I'm 'bout to be a bad magician
God will reveal His tricks, I been had it figured
Say it if y'all know it, so itttt's… (SHOWTIME!)
No slime, that's a gimmick
Y'all wan know why him decided to put Showtime inside him rhymin', right?
Think about it, Frankensteinin', he was realizin' he was dyin'
And he needed a trick tryin' to bring him back to life
But that's magic, right?
But now you're cadaver bruh ('cadabra)
That's your [?] all the theatrics in ya rappin'
Camera trickin' like you snappin'
Take two of ya hot bars, we give 'em direct action
You start overreactin', this is a fact
He even try to reel it in to persuade them to tell you to bring it back
It was hot, but wasn't slick enough to go over nobody head, Permy relax
Ay look, I don't know about the people
But here's why I don't believe you
'Cause how you Vegan, but in ya Showtiming you talkin' 'bout you 'bout to let the beef brew?
And in the ring you one of a kind Verb, nobody hot as you
Wait so you a custom model (Cus D'Amato)
Good, I'm Iron Mikes, I got a box for you
You got a lot of niggas sayin' I ain't got enough to rock witchu
Well you gon' die a critic with them lyin' right on top of you
Ay, diacritic letters got a line right on top of 'U'
My last three, John Cruise through 11 and 0
Beat me? Mission Impossible
Keep it tall, you just lookin' to get a round (around)
But I'm too steep of an obstacle
Y'all think I took Buddy outta Love?
Murphy's Law, you wasn't thinkin' logical
Son, I only took you for this check, I adopted you
I'm raw, y'all lookin' at it backwards
You want the battle, I want the war, it's different rational
Like now we see Captain Marketable to private
So my arm forced to add morale
We different to the core (corp) in general, I got nothin' to prove
I black my ops, you Navy Seal, you just come from the blue
I changed the playin' fields, I rank way above all you dudes
Think chlorine, if you want this war to (water) change just be number one in the pool
Verb you a stupid fuck
When I gotta take niggas to school it's bad news
'Cause I be tearin' all the pupils up
Verb, you know when you hear bad news it be tearin' all them pupils–
Look, Mook a superhero, stage rip
Mention me and beef, the stakes (steaks) lift
If battle rap dyin', I let this cape flip and save shit
Lift the whole culture, make the climate on the plain shift
So fuck bein' grateful, I'm the nigga you need to thank bitch
Easy!

[Round 1: Aye Verb]
What can I say to the great Murda Mook?
Nothin'
'Cause he's the reason we here
Whoever your favorite battle rapper is…
He's the reason that we picked this career
He's the reason that battle rap used to have that chill back then
But he's also the reason that battle rap is gettin' held back still
Before I do this, I challenge you to this throne, young prince T'Challa
Nigga FUCK yo legacy
Nigga FUCK yo honor
Nigga FUCK yo god stuff
Let's see how tough y'all Black Panther is once he get stripped of his powers
Nigga meet yo Killmonger
I have no fear of ya
All the blood I shed in my career was for this moment
I'm a warrior, I pull up in my opponent's city solo
With hot iron loaded and I go drill somethin'
We ain't the same, look at yo battles
You stayed in yo region and had Hot, Iron, Loaded and never killed nothin'
But they say this a big rich town, KATAP!
Target practice at y'all James St. Patrick who not active
And still gettin' praise from all his past shit
Follow me y'all
On Power, that bitch Angela symbolizes the industry
She tries to tell him, ""Turn your back on them Ghost.""
She want you to leave this shit alone and sell an image of hope
But I'm his brother Tommy
I'm tryin' to tell him, ""Nigga we don't fit in wit' them folks.""
Wake up Mook, we battle rappers
Every line we sell dope, in our raps we shell folks
While you at the party witcha wrist froze
With Busta Rhymes and the Flipmode
We out here goin' to war, twin .45's: Donovan Mitchells
Takin' rounds from each other that feel like blows from the Klitschkos
While you drink Dom as you sip Mo'
We out here puttin' in work lettin' clips blow
I done shot my own brothers
Point blank range and watched they shit 'splode
While you cross the street, scared to squeeze and shakin' in this pose
You not one of us
Who you bring on your podcast? NOT ONE OF US
Who you refer when Dame Dash made a film? NOT ONE OF US
You the godfather of this shit
This how you gon' do yo' children?
Nigga you built this buildin'
The roof collapse, you just moved and said ""Fuck the new tenants.""
For the approval of these stars?
Aww dummy, you just that lil' nigga wit bars
Open ya eyes Mook, let me paint this picture of who you are
See you're just a python
And when it's time to throw a mouse in yo face
These industry niggas crowd around your cage wit they pretty gold chains
They watch you eat the mouse, then they clap so amazed
And then they go back to they rich lives
And leave yo silly ass trapped in that cage
Nigga you want acceptance
We bang our shit, nigga we set trip
You selfish
You want us to stay at the bottom like all the shellfish
Yeah you sell tix to come see you rap
But we don't care inside
When you're back we can't stand up for you, the culture paralyzed
You cripled 'em
You tell 'em one number and then you triple them
Death comes in threes, this yo 3rd match, swing on that pendulum
This that old Verb, who tactical and masterful and magical
Time to take this shit back, let's get retractable
I didn't have the drive for this shit but you changed my spark plugs
I'm a rider, I took out animals
Me and them St. Louis niggas, we took the boat Noah's Ark
And turned that bitch to a car club
You delusional, if this was the School of Heart, at graduation when Mook walk, only the flutes would blow
For Verb this gon' get musical
I'ma make this execution beautiful
This is history, you gon' be the first nigga that crack you and do it smooth, you know
But you the first man alive who sold tickets to his own funeral
What's up patna?
Time we peel the layers back like when you burn the toast
Gloves on wit the mask, let's get surgical
Shoulder strap over the arm, how man purses go
Shell project horizontal and send 'em vertical
In the ring wit Verb it's gon' be lines (lions) everywhere
You better learn the ropes
Fuck tryin' to pen wit me, bitch nigga, you better learn the joke
I gave you this home game to exchange verses bro
'Cause if I killed you outta town it's all business
But if you smoke a nigga in his house that shit is personal
Ay, he tried to tell me I'm in some shit like I'm scared
See what he tried to do was stop my mind from movin'
But I'm wit the shit so being in some shit means nothin'
My nigga I been in every kind of sewer
And I learned to love it and became a connoisseur
To St. Louis I'm Obama to 'em
I terminate the Terminators, I'm John Connor to him
Razor blade all in his face, I'll put a comma through him
He don't want this smoke, this shit embalmin' fluid
When I rap I get comets movin'
When you rap niggas get bored (board), how Dennis Rodman do it
I can turn him up or do it calm and suit ya
How you want it? Either way you are fucked
These rounds tonight like Kama Sutra
No fuckin' around before this fight, like how the boxers do it
Y'all Zab Judah, watch how I Kosta Tszyu him
Bring the cocky out him, get his posture ruined
Floyd/Pacquiao take punches, how can I not go through him?
Give a nigga a shot he'll put a hot one through ya
Fuck ya, I ain't star-struck, pussy
Let these new niggas pay homage to you
It's time to eat I'ma go noodles like a college student
Your streak I'ma end dat (in debt) like a college student
For the record I'm layin' the beat down, but I'm not producin'
You ain't wit the toxic, stop it Mooky
It's monsters where I'm from, I live through
Yo mama wouldn't even let you watch this movie
A lot to do wit drums movin', snares poppin' like rock acoustics
This Dr. Seuss shit vers' the Constitution?
Man, I ain't here to praise him tonight, now ask me why
(Why?!)
'Cause don't god gotta be good to you first before you hallelujah?
That's how I'ma do ya

[Round 2: Murda Mook]
Ay, Smack called me, I was gettin' some head
He said, ""I want you to battle Surf, Mook
But I ain't got all the bread.""
But it's an opportunity bro, these Summer Madnesses
But I ain't got all your cabbage.""

You gon' fumble or you gon' choke nigga
You rap like you inebriated, here's why I know (wino) nigga
Verb, what's up wit all the slurs and the mumblin'
Tr-tryin' to get out bars, you stumblin'
What was the purpose (porpoise) of a Flubberfin?
Ay, Ay (AA) punk don't tell me you gettin' drunk again
Well you standin' up against shots that ain't got no names
That's the first step that I'll admit
And trust me Chaz, I can haul it (alcoholic)
Hope you don't think a nine'll miss (anonymous)
Ay, how it feel bein' the designated guy to whip?
Ya peeps grievin', see you sleepin' in pee, stinkin' while you sip
Oh you some kinda friend, you got me fucked up
Don't wanna question my drive and test my lines
Like if I point nine (.09) I ain't blowin' it
That's a breath of lies (breathalyz-er)
Ay, this different here man
We wake up wit headaches when you rhyme
Rubbin' our temples wanna forget you
'Cause you bottom-shelf and all ya boo's (booze) is 100% proof
Ay this steel (distill) is what you call a licker (liquor)

Watch how you talk to killers (Tequilas)
They whine (wine) and bitter, battle nigga tender
Can't bare (beer) admittin' that I'm more G
Defend a bender (fender bender)
Bar hop and mention these rounds on me, that's whiskey business
How your dumb ass fought me for gettin' you off the concrete?
See I meant (cement) to put you six feet in it
He on Twitter dissin' Omar Epps all night, you brawl light
Just 'cause he root for me
You shouldn't put ya racks up if ya bra tight
But unlike you that kid a computer whiz, he the smart type
'Cause he learned his lesson
You a fool thinkin' he gonna go against God twice
Oh Verb nigga, I heard nigga that you a herb nigga
Bird nigga, pick up the burner, bullets burn niggas
Heard niggas submerge in him, then they turn in him
Curve in him, stuck in his sternum, they stern in him
Surgeon and all of his nurses they concerned for him
Murmurin', ""No savin' Verb,"" now they confirmin' him
Comatose, ay I got ya daughter home alone
She real spazzin' and I'm laughin'
'Cause she askin', ""Where my daddy? Why he can't return?""
I told that little bastard, the ER is where you are (UR)
Well let me give it to y'all St. Louis accent
I bet you wishin' you was h(ER)e with h(UR)r
I see the broke spirit in your mirror Verb
Seven years of worst, straight up bad luck
We saw Rex break his ass up
Shine zipped the bag up
Half A Gallon took all the ounces out ya tank to gas up
You got worked by a dirt Smurf named Twork
Off his name alone you shoulda known you supposed to shake his ass up
Man, did you really believe that they believed you was gonna succeed as the winner?
You think this league'll (legal) aid you wit gettin' Murda?
You buggin' nigga, you a public defender
I saw the pretender addin' a buncha them niggas under his Twitter
Tryin' to superhero to form against me like the fuckin' Avengers
I'm the real, they knows (Thanos) and I'm stone cold
And gon' let (gauntlet) reality be my decision to shape
And I ride despite a man (Spider-Man) died
'Cause this appear (disappear) that you dissin' a great (disintegrate)

Ay, I passed ARP, he one I blame too
Take this L, Jackson, you ain't a Marvel captain
To be honest, we still tryna figure out why he paid/paged you
Even on a break too
I hit a clear lane to the bucket, man it's disgustin'
It's like I mistimed my jumpin'
How I'm spazzin' on Mr. Duncan (dunkin')
He in his interview soundin' grumpy
""Why Mook want all this money?""
Is you serious? Well since you curious
It's 'cause I'm like a lower case 'i', top of the fuckin' line, period
That's why my capital type major
Look at the keyboard, watch
You see the power is at the top, I makes a lot (salat)
This Llama lake him (assalamualaikum)
Why would I lie (Allah)?
I'm sorta cocky 'cause my aura got me (origami) foldin' a lot of paper
I divide ya sweetie pie
She said her's the number that I should favor
But I said nah, 'cause bottom line, we ain't have nothin' in common to nominate her (denominator)
So fuck it I gotta–, nah, I'm not a hater
Plus I heard she a hard sucker
So muhfucka I save her for Now & Later
I came back a hour later
On wool sheets I put his baby to sleep (sheep), you know Murda
She whispered in her ear ""the greatest""
And the GOAT heard her (herder)
She told that nigga bye (baaah)
Put V to the side, but you already know that
'Cause I'm greater than
So she figured the GOAT is who she need to go at
Man, split it down the middle, that's a riddle
While you unfold that, I unload a whole MAC in ya gold caps
Player, I'm the coach, I help to press (depress)

They want you to win, it's just you can't slip that bullshit by us
Our heart authentic, we don't rent it
Don't you even try to lend (Len) Bias
NY ain't ya habitat, everybody know that's a fact
Open ya phone, even Siri will (cereal) tell you
You ain't a nigga that the Apple Jack
Mook a superhero stage rip

Lift the whole culture, make the climate on the plain shift

[Round 2: Aye Verb]
When you battled Lux, you beat Lux, straight up, no shade wit it
It's all fair when it's war
The way you won just wasn't quite my style, you played different
You took Lux secret diss record to Bus' and got it played nigga?
Oh, where I'm from that's called straight snitchin
It's ironic you the first good schoolboy I've met without great principle
I'm from the hood, I guess I'm raised different
Example: I got enemies that I know for a fact shot at niggas I slapped fives wit, but I take it to the grave wit me
Dot Mobb, how y'all develop a squadron
Wit a leader who got gelatin in his posture?
The number one rule of war is keep it silent
No snitchin', no women or children, if it's problems?
Only a coward believes any and every element is an option
Nigga save that bang bang shit, nigga we know player
Dot Mobb, you fuck wit us, yeah we locate 'em
I love my niggas-
(Look at him, he emotional!)
I love my niggas so them not favors
Shoot one of mine I shoot back, give 'em a bag and relocate 'em
You the rookie, you don't see no stages
You just Markelle Fultz but on the flo' nigga he's no Tatum
Are y'all kiddin' me holmes?
Do y'all listen to the lyrics of what this nigga be on?
I motivate the block, rocks in yo hand, young nigga get on
When he talks rock in yo hand it's silly shit like Infinity Stones
Gun down our president, I'ma be known
Like the nigga that got Kennedy gone
I'm good, money, the city's capitol, Italy, Rome
In the room it may feel like you winnin', bitch listen
On cam, my opponents don't even know that they dead
I Sixth Sense 'em
I'm conscious, but I go back and forth, I'm switch flippin'
Behind mine, yo words don't even sound the same, ya pitch shiftin'
Fuck this, unlimited rounds, they DID book me for a long time
Fuck a preview, let's let that beef brew, in 3D too
(So it's Showtime!)
I told my bitch we ain't celebratin' shit, we go mama
Itinerary, kill him we skatin', we roll bouncin'
Hollow-points all in the .40 look like I load mountains
Y'all best pound for pound 'bout to get drug
And broken down into whole ounces
You an old vulture in a roll-out chair
An old voucher and that boy Mook a whole ho outchea
Yo, you ride for the minds of these niggas that play with Legos
I'm crazy wit it, I'll stick a fork in ya noodle
Twist it, pull it back and then lick the Prego
Straps I stay wit one, Mook, a nigga faithful
Don't judge me, I come from hammers bangin'
And white folks yellin' ""Case closed!""
I'll get yo bitch snatched, not where her waist go
Pesos, wanna get the bitch back? Then bring a case load
A body bag is what you prayin' fo'
But a dog fight is what I'm paid fo'
When it's war I don't play bro
I'm up early throwin' rounds in that toaster: Leggo my Eggo
Yo rhyme faces don't match yo vibrations
When it's over you gon' be sour, don't cry baby
With great power comes responsibility
In yo tainted mind, the odds of killin' me
Was equal to the arms of centipedes
But I'm too cold, you can't see me like the winter's leaves
Thank me later, 'cause you losin' if you don't lose
And check the files, every winner bleeds
After tonight the biggest three
Gon' be me first, Lux here and since I'm bein' beatin' you
You gon' have to get in the middle of us, you must intervene
Nigga I will cave yo chest in
Slap box wit all your inner beings
You prolly rolled here in a limousine
Which is more than form fittin' for kings
Each time they get they wings
Nah, you ain't a king nigga, you's a pawn
And in real life nigga you's a corn
You try to say you different
And all the rest of us niggas is all in uniform
That's why I'ma put one in yo head since you the unicorn
I asked some street niggas 'bout John
They like, ""Who is the dude?""
You an actor, nobody remember you young like John Witherspoon
That's pops nigga
Top splittin', slot switchin' like I'm not spittin'
Fix yo face or get botched nigga
No, you are not one of the Wolves, you're not Wiggins
Sorry, gotta get rid of you son like Doc Rivers
How you not get it? I may win, I might lose
But when I fall I give the fans the feelin' of when Mike lose
I been past my test nigga, this night school
Nigga ya pen high school
You come back to the game wit the same moves every time like you Ken/Ryu
You a lil Loc wit this killin' Murda, you got Lorenz IQ
And I'm a Menace, I don't blend like you
Nigga I ride through Harlem on four [?]
Hangin' out the window wit a fully auto
All the bullies that I know they got spin cycle
Yo bitch nothin', only bitches who nothin' attract men like you
My dick get hard, I extend rifles
Boy I make yo' Bigfoot bitch blow me until her windpipe loose

{Crowd starts booing and loosing their shit}
Here come the hate. Here come the hate. It's NOTHING. Easy work. Here come the hate. Say no more. I love it. I love it

Now who believes hustle stories from y'all? Like y'all bleeders
If you catch runnin' spots, nigga we all cheaters (cheetahs)
Cannons, light up you and yo girl, we called Cheaters
I ain't here to play witchu dawg, this y'all recess
In this battle realm I'm looked upon as a reject
You know why? 'Cause I'm the only nigga sellin' heroin on this weed set
Breathe on 'em, why exhale?
I'm talkin' bars in a big boy fashion
I'm talkin' Big T in a five XL, wide as hell
You ain't known for rhymin' well
So when you be okay you like a dirty nigga in a fresh tee and some Jordans, Mook, you look fly as hell

[Round 3: Murda Mook]
Now before we begin (vegan)
I'ma need them to get deep into this
'Cause y'all got me battlin' a nigga that don't even exist
You picked the name 'Verb'
The definition of that word mean action
But if action causes reaction you abstract, let's speak facts then
Pay attention to me captain
Listen to what I'm tellin' you
If your existence predicates off decisions you hypothetical
If I'm gettin' too much ahead of you
Well let me try helpin' you and gettin' it clear
The stage: matter, we can touch it, we can feel it, it's here
Now, I can run on it, jump on it, whatever one I wanna display
But until I decide what action I wanna take
A verb can never come into play
See this how I'm gonna renown (re-noun)
'Cause these rounds these crowds graspin'
But see, nouns we need Verb to add description to shit that's happenin', that's why I need you Verb
Because you help me manifest a lesson I wanna fulfill
That the only reason you existin'
Is because you position next to somethin' that's real
Do you feel? I'm on ya heels
This marble floor is versatile (vs a towel)
I shine off a pile of shit, different that I do
Sprints from flicks I get reviewed, businesses I get renewed
Parquet or park floor, I ain't picky when I choose
Fuck where the Surf is, if the turf switch
Then I guess Mike'll be skippin' to the Lou'
(JayBlac you better listen now!)
Ay, Mook, why you by yourself in the Wraith for? (Rafer)
Oh this an empty V (MTV) 'cause I'm Conceited now
Plus y'all know I'm used to whippin' Lux-ury
Why y'all got me pushin' this bum-ass V around?
Of course, you my brother
I tried to open these doors for Surf
Who the fuck told you you could ride?
Now it was in vain (vein) takin' that risk (wrist) pushin' Tsu aside (suicide)
Oh, and I hope you ain't think that you could hide
If you don't think that your parents let us know
Who are you inside, bruh you a lie
Like this created playa haircut and this beige thing on ya beard son
That just tell us all you do is dye (die)

{crowd starts booing}

Why you always callin' niggas ""ugly""?
You don't think that's weird son?
You even called me ugly, well I can be all that and some
But then here come my question, and I think it's a pretty fair one
If you think niggas is ugly
Well why don't you tell us what niggas you think is handsome?
Ay Verb, ay look, and in ya parking lot sprint-cident (sprint incident), I tried to get you against all of my man's son
I said, ""It's so hot up here son."" I mean yeah son
They caught the kid nappin', but if you look close
You see he tryin' to get money, that's why he ran some (ransom)
Chaz a bitch, tee-off on him like I had a lisp
Sound of a Tech-9, feel like Easter, I'm about to have a fit
You try to spin, get ya back caught
That's the way the god play
All I do is amaze (a maze) you gotta find out the hard way
Daylyt gave me a call say, ""Son (sun) this nigga 24 hours straight.""
I couldn't even take the shine for it, 'cause that was all Day
Wait, don't we got unlimited time for it? Oh we got all day
Ay, I'ma bang 'til this clip drop
This body a quick fix, you a pit stop
The way I'm snappin' on you, prolly got you in shock
I'm Bill Collector wit the fifth cocked
I'm 'bout to Showout wit a big knot
Strip you out ya socks, make you kick rocks in flip flops
Two bricks out the nick, five hours, six tops
I took trips with no stashes and the whip hot
You ever seen cops and almost had some shit dropped?
I took risks to let the bricks clot
I had six under me, twelve all on top of me, no tick tocks
Look, you need to blame ARP, he the one who did this to you
So we don't gotta discuss then (disgustin')
Why you was this pick-able (despicable)
Same nigga who said the white man trickin' you
Then with the dude, KOD just typical
I think we beyond sayin' (Beyonce) this nigga's a jiggaboo (Jigga boo)
Well I'm Hov in the elevator, I'm calm when shit gettin' tricky
I don't respond when little sissies try and kick it wit me
Wicky wicky, back when Smack recordin' was important
Missouri was sorta slow
Thought I could set (cassette) the table for him
But rewind, realize that time I was too fast for it (forward)
Pause it, aw shit, niggas you millennial
Picture you gettin' rid of Mook
You digital, my real (reel) is old school original
I ain't need the tool, I made the streets move
I had the people eager to see Mook
Make a scene, that was pre views
Fuck all the battle rappers who came to see me lose
Suck my dick, I hope all y'all kids die in preschool
Oh and you think I ain't peep you
All your rants that you ain't verified on Instagram
Listen man, give that shit up
They prolly e-mailed you and said, ""We'll give you a check…
Right after you get it from Lux.""
I know you saw him as an influence, but now turnin' vegan
Preachin' about all the wrongs men doin'
It ain't no accident, you wanted y'all collision that bad you turned into him
Ay, he gave you credit on the card when he rhyme
You asked to battle, he declined
But he already gave you rounds when he curved you three times
But speakin' on that night Verby
When I started his career, let's tell it right Verby
I knew you from nobody (no body)
And went out on a limb and saved you from arms and feet
Shoulda let you get tore so (torso) we coulda seen Vegan Verb vegetable since you are what you eat
But my smarts they elite, listen hard it get deep
Let me soul a (solar) system, this is when you and I verses (universes) meet, a solid G (astrology)
Would I be goin' too far if I said you are only a star 'cause of me?
Alright, when my consolation (constellation)
Be the battle that let us all know who you are with SB
Son of a bitch that was me!
But see males and females
I was pushin' through my own agenda (gender)
Bitch nigga, the whole St. Louis owe a nigga
He don't think so, here go the picture
He was the first nigga from over there to come over here to battle rap
If you woulda got crippled like Hurricane
And they woulda got wind of that attack
We woulda torn they doe (tornado) up
Stormed out of New York, wouldn't have came back after that
That's a fact, imagine that
No rabbit hat, woulda never seen a Magic act
And Yung Ill catchphrase woulda never had that impact
He woulda hit Beasley to come through as a spitta
And ""Who is this nigga?""
That woulda been the question he got back from Smack
Nick Cannon wouldn't know who Hitman is
And we woulda been hearin' 'bout who Hitman's hitman is
So yeah, take it personal
But if it wasn't for Murda Mook, Lux curvin' you
Woulda been the last time niggas heard the Lou'
But remember, we all remember that line
""Making his guardian angel duck""
Well I got my own guardian angel
And he told me yours ain't like that part you was sayin' too tough
That's why he not here to save you bruh
'Cause your guardian next to my guardian
Party Arty and they partyin' hard
Hardy hardyin' is watchin' me straighten you up
Ay, Verb, your bars is wack and ya lingo
I'll throw a hand grenade through ya baby window
Kill ya extended family with the same extendo
Small carrier in the pocket: that's a plane memento
But the Midwest movement, y'all was percolatin'
The ground workin' person put round on that circuit
Y'all was circulatin'
You Holla, Ill, RemyD, shit y'all birthed the nation
If you hollered ill (Holla, Ill)
Then RemyD (remedy) would be the first to aid him
But RemyD got Ill, tried to Holla at Verb to save him
Verb hollered ""Eww, nah RemyD, let the nurses take him.""
Then Ill needed remedy, needed–
But the Midwest movement, y'all was percolatin'
The ground workin' person put round on that circuit
Y'all was circulatin'
You Holla, Ill, RemyD, shit y'all birthed the nation
If you hollered ill then RemyD would be the first to aid him
But Remedy got ill, tried to holla at Verb to save him
Verb hollered ""Eww, not RemyD, let the nurses take him.""
Then Ill needed remedy, needed Holla and Verb replace him
They had an ill remedy for that: Holla and Verb replaced him
Now it's just Holla and Verb, prolly heard niggas, heard the hatin'
Still it's just absurd with the Holla and Verb debatin'
Turn the pages, now observe Holla and Verb on stages
Hollerin' verbs and phrases, a lot of disturbin' statements
On why they deserve the greatness
We ain't tear the Midwest down
Y'all know who the ones to blame is?
All y'all gotta do when y'all around, look in each other faces!
But speakin' of faces, you put a blindfold on yours against X Factor
What the fuck? Was that a phase?
You makin' up new card games?
Blindfoldin', wait, you combine poker wit playin' spades?
Bet, so when my man go to raise, you gon' hit the deck after
And he gon' leave you blind and folded on the stage
'Cause he my X Factor
You talk foul on these lines 'til the ref at ya
And if you try to argue the call, you gon' get a TEC (tech) after
But let's back up, 'cause if we speakin' of poker
I think with our careers, that's the game it relate to
Like to acknowledge the fact that I seen you I had to raise you
Let's put it on the table
I knew I had the winnin' hand before ARP revealed the card
I can say that wit a straight face too
Oh you straight boo, means a full house will call ya bluff
The king back shittin' on niggas: that's a royal flush
You wanna know how I do pussy niggas that be talkin' rough?
It ain't a tough call, I just smack the dog shit out
In front of niggas that call you tough
Or shatter your jaw up, put you in the surgery
'Cause I heard if it's glass you supposed to break in case of emergency
I can't believe they got me battlin this cornball
I'll put bread on this beef and get it handled with a stick, that's a corndog
Yo, you owe me money Verby, I ain't allowin' no debts to fester
Peel down ya neck, the best suppressers, oppress the pressure
The length of the shit I'm with (width) will prolly seem extra extra
It's tailor suited for a body
It's an addresser (a dresser) for desperate measures
Get him hemmed, license to kill, somethin' bright on the steel

Straight bang up your head shit with
Phenomenal swing like the ass on a black chick
Fat dick to all of y'all niggas with whack clicks
Hoping they whip paper like a classic, low budget black flick
Last victim that I caught was fucking my last chick
She hit me off, nearly made me bust through my plastic
Took the loot that she had stashed in her panty elastic
She got from out my denim, little venom was fast, kid
Try to swindle a nigga by giving me putang
A new thang, chick wanted to fuck me to Wu-Tang
Thug chicks started criticizing my new slang
Started hitting the pussy the song from the wusang
Watch these rap niggas get all inside your guts man
My nuts hang, shorty stay abusing the love thang
Gotta camouflage my stash and loot like I'm Bruce Wayne
After my money gotta kick the bitch up like Liu Kang

[Chorus]
Ayo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Oh yeah
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Okay

[Verse 2]
Shorty took me on a ride like a cyclone
In my zone, strutting with an ass and a fly tone
Hold shorty like how I be holding my microphone
We thug romancing to the jazzy sound of a xylophone
Ass backwards I'ma stick you more than a cactus
Lay my thug willy actress across the mattress
Knock it off the earth axis and broken glasses
Continue when she make me bust blackberry molasses
Pussy made me feel like I was drugged up on morphine
My movie screen ass stacking more than we've all seen
Yo, chick 'bout to make me wile on her real hard
A real fraud, fuck I ever fucked with this ill broad
Chick still after my loot, she like, ""What, son?""
Don't act dumb scheming on a robbery outcome
Come out from wherever you are and be outdone
Acting like you about something, and you ain't about none
Come on son! Thought the chicken head was a little rude
The wrong move making me whip it out like live dude
Fuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack
Too many times, gotta put my foot in her ass crack
June for all of my niggas you know shit is all real
A chicken head to fuck your mans and cut him a side deal
Of all your prized possessions if you let her get yours
Bitch we keep it raunchy, everything will remain raw

[Chorus]
Ayo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
Oh yes
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw

Pull up in the whip, pop the trunk, feel it?
Barefoot gorilla baboon funk, ya hear it?
Me and my nigga Richie was itchy to meet some women
Met some chickens, they was actin so snobby and bitchy, fuck it
Pass me the sticky
The chicky wanted to leave me with a kiss and a hickie
I ain't wit it but give me a quicky, I ain't in to doin the licky-licky
Even though you be lookin so pretty, I own all of my shit, never 50-50
Oodle noodles all 'dose fools never refuse, accuse me for the bruise
Chick got a rattling sound, better tighten the screws
Runnin and gunnin, kinda stunnin
The way we be comin around, slummin, wylin and dollin
My nigga Horace kick up a nigga like Chuck Norris
Got some other niggas lost way up in the forest
Hang you up in a harness, label me and all of my niggas the hardest
Fuck around, be the next ""Formerly Known As"" artist
Layed out with a goddess, pretty lilly Adonis
Besides all of that, niggas is novice, I make you all a promise
The promise is that I'm so dominant and that I am so prominent
Captured the whole of Asia as a continent
Oh shit, I be comin and tumblin down, rumblin, stumblin down
Freaky prophet with unusual musical sound
Bringin the ruckus, you motherfuckers be givin me pounds
'Semite Sam, give me the camcorder and a city with plans
Me and my fam, hustle and tussle in makin this groove, me and my mans

What we gon' do? (Do it to death)

[Verse 2]
Yo! Pin or a needle, make you wobble or weeble
Niggas is feeble, back in the day I used to get money illegal
Get some ass, cop a room down at the Regal
Hit you wit so much drama make niggas always wait for the sequel
Yo there ain't no equal on how we be reppin for the people
Yo there really ain't no equal.....
Ask Hillary, met her down on Flatbush and Tillory
She killin me, got me crazy, wylin, actin straight grizzly
We never made it too far together
I left her standin on Franklin and Willoughby
Another mystery to me
While she still on the corner kissin at me, hissin at me
Ignorin these bitches, they're angry, now they're riffin at me
Vital and critical, literal lyrical, make niggas pitiful
Go to the clinical, examine your physical
Frightening and enlightening at the same time
Get the goods and price them, and doin the heist again
You thinkin we would be nice again
We on a mission, we don't need none of your advice again
Hold me down BABY, pitter patter, you chitter chatter too much
I'mma splitter splatter your blidder bladder
Make you spill out your guts

Penalized doing it till he get tired of ya boy

Leaving y'all niggas blurry blurry
Brew up some shit like I'm cooking for y'all

Federal cases cause nuff bodies end up in medical places
In they blood finding them chemical traces
Leaving special investigators going through skeptical phases
While we getting money the decimal changes
I was a seven-day affentice apprentice

Blowing the door right up off of the hinges

Derange your whole circular shape into triangular nigga

That I had to bring this shit to a screaming halt
What you need to do is open up the vault
That's why I make sure that my vest will be on
So when I blast you and your additional stress will be gone
Then I sprinkle just a little bit of salt on your plans
And watch your shit shrivel up right in the palm of my hands
I ain't afraid of ya
But I thank all of my niggas for saving ya
I was about to take you back
To when your mother was making ya
Clapping you up
Slapping you up
Trapping you up
Holding you hostage
Duck taping and Saran wrapping you up
Yo

I smell aroma
Put you in a Trans
And slip into an irreversible coma
Fuck y'all cubic zirconium niggas it's over
Closing in on all y'all niggas
While we're moving in a little closer
Then I evaluate and elaborate
Confiscate your shit and dare your ass to retaliate

Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
This, means, WAR!!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggas
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggas
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'mma BANISH you all
And celebrate all in your absence once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my mens
Turn your back on me, and I'mma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay TRUE -- now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'mma throw you WAY over the edge
THIS MEANS WAR!!

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggas standin alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggas goin the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggas, breakin the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we takin your head;
THIS MEANS WAR!!

Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!!
I'mma BE the best to show love let's co-operate
Disloyalty is somethin that we won't tolerate
Deal with these niggas, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know

[Verse]
Though some of us have been poisoned
Many of us have been blessed
And through the worst shit
That we all as people go through
Every blessing that we are blessed to have
Are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
And makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
Everything and every motherfucker gets dealt with accordingly
Mark my words
See I remember on The Coming album
You know when there was only five years left
It was once said that there was no time
To take time for granted
Well we are now face to face with that very given time
There's only one year left motherfuckers
1999
The dawn of the new millennium
I understand though
Sometimes it takes time
And hands-on extreme hardship experience
To realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
By all means
It will always be better to be safe than to be sorry
So as we finally approach the year 2000
Behold what it might have in store for us people
There have been many indications of changes
That will occur, that has already occurred
That were not and will not be set up to our benefit, as people
But in order for us to continue to build
We must destroy
And unfortunately in the process
Many of us will be liable candidates
Of being destroyed
But in the bigger scheme of things we must defend
What we all collectively identify with as the truth
And with what is right
To all my live soldiers
And all my live women
Those who may not survive the turning point
May you forever rest peacefully
As you are delivered back to the essence
So I dedicate this burial song to all of you
To my survival of the most fit for real niggas
And women no doubt
Continue to get what's yours from out this fucker
Before your time run out
And may the force of survival forever rest with y'all
My live motherfuckers
To all my survivalists
See you in the next thousand year period
Allah bless all y'all
Flipmode continue to bounce
Like a satellite in orbit
Seein' all you motherfuckers at every angle
The imperial, the universal, powerful Flipmode squad
Stay tuned
See y'all motherfuckers, January 1st 2000

And every move is intentional
Violate and I will get at yo' ass
And if I can't catch you track star
We'll start throwin' shit at yo' ass
Wait a minute nigga, hold up second
See youse a bitch and while we bust yo' ass
Yo' faggot peoples ain't even checkin'
Yo y'all need to send the coroner, shit

With specific high-explosives
Just to take y'all niggas out of this element, now

'Cause we got new shit for y'all
All my niggas in the spots, y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga
And we come to take shit over y'all

Ever since I vowed to keep the shit raw

That'll leave they fuckin face on the floor
Everytime niggas know when we black
Smack a nigga so fuckin hard
He'll fall and probably spin on his back
Funny how niggas'll always shit talk
The very next day they will notice the difference
In the way they bitch walk
My street niggas need to come for the ride
Cause when we step up in the place
You funny niggas need to slide to the side
I love to watch these funny niggas diminish
And while we slowly murder them niggas
They prayin' on the moment we finish
I take you back to the very beginnin'
And beat you in yo' head from birth
And watch you grow lovin' the shit we be bringin'
Street niggas keep they mind on they dream
Focus the most on gettin' they paper
And be thoroughly reppin' they team
You know we quick to mash it down for some hours
Quick to leave some of these niggas shook
Runnin with the rest of them cowards
And leave the rest of niggas ready to dumb
And rep the street until we all die
Could give a fuck wherever you from, now

'Cause we got new shit for y'all
All my niggas in the spots, y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga

Nevertheless, address the cheddar for the treasure chest
And bless the spot before the thugs protest, one time
I hope y'all know just what the motherfuck you dealin' with
With so much platinum for the street, you thought I was a silversmith
We phat now, so look at how we brought it back now
And made it possible for street niggas to hold a stack now
And become the wealthiest, healthiest
And bring the fire that will reach about 1000 degrees celsius
Hold on, banker's money better roll on, or sing a broke folk song
My nigga's so long he paid with a big brim hat, just like a lampshade
And bounce, wildin' in the truck, the joints my nigga Ramp made
We be them new millennium prime time niggas
Walk a fine line, niggas sippin fine wine niggas
Now, if you cross the line and fuck around them blind niggas
With so much pressure it's like we did the illest crime, nigga
What? You know I'm like a loco man, noble man
Turned global man, rippin' bi-coastal like a postal man
And when we come, you know we came to get it

Let's get this money nigga

[Verse 4: Roc Marciano]
Yeah, we near the mind out west
Somewhere in Africa
The Feds is after us, vest on my back
Whippin the Acuras, feel like a mac bustin
A rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothin
A hail storm, ice rainin, mind containin
Info, nigga what you in for? Complainin
Six bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speakin through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flarin gunmen
Hate to see me comin like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm huggin
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunkin Donut precious size stones make me wanna cut the safe open
Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick
Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Plannin the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tie a rag tight
Throwin light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talkin foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, ya'll niggas know we skated early
Disguised ourselves as Hasidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard
Like Turks and Caicos
Everytime we hit, we in and out quick
Don't be surprised if we behind supplyin niggas all the platinum and shit

[Outro]
Money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
Money, money
Yeah, the world's greatest jewel heist
Thoroughly and successfully executed
By none other than Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef
Rock Marciano and Busta Rhymes
A job well done, fellas, very good piece of work",eastcoast

I can't wait to make my trip outta town, son
We gon' do it, son
All them bitches, twistin' that tower, word
Ayo, ayo, here's y'all niggas tickets, man
The bus leavin' right now
Ayo, listen to me, man, when y'all get on the bus, y'all niggas don't even sit together
Act like y'all don't know each other, like you're undercover on the motherfuckin' bus or somethin', know what I mean?
When y'all get there, hit the terminal, y'all gon' meet my man Ty gon' pick y'all up, know what I'm sayin'?
Take y'all out to this hustlin' spot we got out there, Newton Park out on Norfolk, you know what I mean?
Most def', most def'
Where the money is proper, the hustle is proper, you know what I mean?
Uh-huh, straight gangsta
Want you to go out there, y'all handle your business, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
Alright
Straight like that, aight?
One love, man
Mon, baby
Okay
Get up with you, man
Call me, call me

[Verse 1]
Yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with a lot of things they want em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin', word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin' a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin' that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin' wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they changed from medallions to iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they ain't obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers gettin' five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin' pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white

[Interlude]
""Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
And shut the fuck up""
""Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like...""
""Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates
And the gym star""
""Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that""
""Fuck this shit""

[Verse 2]
Yeah, see how we blowin' pa
The lookout niggas holdin' fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin' on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eatin'
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin'
The whole town, see we now own it
Carryin' on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin' cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin' as workin' niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin' like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Ain't it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun, bust straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started buggin' when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelins no more
More the actin' up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said cut

[Outro]
That's a wrap, good actin' motherfuckers, good actin
That's the shit I'm talkin' about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers

From the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort
From the beginning and the birth of this whole shit
To the now success of this whole shit
And all my peoples that be holdin' it down for their peoples
Ridin with them through thick and thin, love y'all niggas

[Verse 1]
Now, this how the shit all started
Was like doctors of [?] I was being conceived kinda retarded
Like, and while my moms was conceiving this beautiful baby
Doctors was the this woman's stress out of this Jamaican lady
Pops beef and straight carrying on
Nobody realizing how the god was now being born
Ayo, yo, 1, 2
While they was wildin' and shit
They couldn't even find my pulse, sonogram on the frisk
So, they tried a natural birth, but had to stop production
Baby stuck all up in the womb, another malfunction
1, 2
And now the doctors discover
They had to cut this lady's gut, and c-section me out of my mother
Pop duke could only sit and ask why
Looked up in the sky and begged for mercy from the most high
C'mon, now, 1, 2
See now the day would feel blessed
Watching the birth of a precious baby life manifest
See how that bugged me out

[Chorus]
1, 2 (That shit, that type shit be buggin me out 'cause)

[Verse 2]
Young and learnin' shit that started is thick
Started inquiring a lot, started using my dick
Like I knew it all but I wasn't really knowin' and shit
Buggin when my pubic hairs started growin' and shit
Now hold up, a young nigga now a couple years pass
Searchin desperate to experience my first piece of ass
Now, gettin' into mischief and caught my first arrest
Started smoking weed and started totin' on them cigarettes
Eyes bloodshot like I was starin' at a highbeam
Nigga only twelve so why he lookin' like he nineteen?
1, 2
The fast life baby, young with an old soul
From the past life baby
A young nigga wanted things and wanted money quick
Ambitious on the Amtrak, with a quarter brick
My nigga, 1, 2
It got hot in the streets
My nigga campaign the cops who started walkin' the beat, my nigga
Trouble causin' too much problems just me and my brother
Made mommy a grandma and shacked up with my babymother
Now it a seed, I was always ready to clap shit
Strugglin', so then I start fuckin 'round with this rap shit
Moved to Long Island and got up with a few niggas
Believin we could show the world we was the Leaders Of the New niggas
A crew of niggas that was hot like an infirmary
Blazin' 'til they started actin' like bitches internally
So now, Flipmode is how we own it fo' sho
Tried to fuck with niggas but I couldn't do it no more
Fo rilla, 1, 2
And then I got with some niggas
Always wit it to multiply the gross and double the figgas
And then I, hit with bombs and hold a stack in my palms
Whippin' Bentleys, floss icy shit and take care of moms
Give the local little old man a job as my chaeuffeur
Hold it down for all my niggas til the movement is over
It's kinda beautiful

All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (Situations they try to set up for niggas to fuckin' fall off)

Ay look, the cowboy ain't wanna meet (meat) on URL
So Rare Breed was the medium to cater the plate
This beef 'bout to get done well
Y'all 'bout to see the vegan done made a mistake (made him a steak)
Do him greasy, finger lickin', savor the taste
Talkin' Beasley, SMACK niggas, stay in ya place
You get shot in ya face, and then shot in ya face more
They say, ""Mook you went overboard.""
Of course, that's how you make sure (shore)
Let's pick up the pace
Chase gave a nigga from the Lou' the baton
Well I got him, no problem
It's gonna look like the bottoms after I stomp blood out him
Mr. Easy Bucket stupid, this feat (feet) you in
A Christian Lou' been (Loubin') for the win, I'ma shoo (shoe) in
And guess who doin' the bap, bap, bap ties and the gat risin'
They all come my way with detention
End up gettin' the same sentence
Start with I, chalk lines, mad times, I show 'em the ropes
Now this is where Chaz ties in (chastising)
If I don't put Chaz man in a casket
Shiiit, you gon' be nappin' on a mattress
With a permanent address at the hospital
The sight gon' be the saddest, it's tragic
Imagine havin' to see ya kid try to play peek a boo witchu in ICU (and I see you)
I can see more wrong (moron) when I see you
God got a devilish sense of humor, that's probably true
I mean his test gotta be a few of the funniest jokes
Like, ""Don't y'all think it's hilarious that after you just decided to stop eatin' meat, that man put you right in front of the GOAT.""
Here this guy go (Geico), ""Mook ain't got bars, he just be talkin', he borin'.""
I'm ensurin' (insuring) that's one of your quotes
Well if Progressive punchlines whatchu want, fine
But you better hold that same fuckin' policy for your rhymes
I'm 'bout to have each and everyone behind you mournin' (morning), sunshine
The stream ran I'm a heavy fav'
So much damn (dam) damage the levees break
Me, I championed every weight
Light weight to heavy weight
Every class that was dealt, blood let's demonstrate
Pussy I got it locked and I ain't never introducin' Chaz to these (chastity) belts
This a case of mistaken identity, ARP givin' me the wrong person
For him remember, these jail bars wasn't meant for
So in a sense (innocence) it'll be, now you can't bail 'cause you don't know the shit you in for
This your day to loss (data loss), backup everything like when you send off your phone the Sprint store
'Cause if boy can't walkie what he talkie
Well that's the kinda shit I give you 10 for (10-4)
*ch-ch* ""Man down""
It was Math Hoffa who wanted this fuckin' loss
But me and Math campaign (cam' pain) don't add up for promo
I don't care what it cost
Now here's news for you Verb
If I'm puzzled by your words, then the lead put you right in the box
Straight up and down, I ain't the one to cross
This .40 kick back hard as a fuckin' horse
Push ya shit back like, ""Huh, I think this one is yours.""
Or I lift a rusty brown .44

{Aye Verb finally has enough of Mook poking and pushing him and a fight breaks out}

Push ya shit back like, ""Huh, I think this one is yours.""
Or I lift a rusty brown .44
Empty three (MP3), Verb see these (CD's) ain't around no more
I planned your Geronimo a long time ago
Clumsy nigga, fell for it though
The ho thought he caught the drop
But the grip is like a whip without standin' tickets, I keep it on the lot (on a lot)
Picture me debatin' with the haters about the greatest names is, ""What four?""
What for? When the last time you saw a picture of God carved on Mt. Rushmore?
Huh, huh, huh, uh? Mr. Important Number, you recall
How I did the Jewish boy
When Mook awarded […] that shit was Biblical
Now he worshipin' me with his gefilte fish
Man listen, I'm 'bout to be a bad magician
God will reveal His tricks, I been had it figured
Say it if y'all know it, so itttt's… (SHOWTIME!)
No slime, that's a gimmick
Y'all wan know why him decided to put Showtime inside him rhymin', right?
Think about it, Frankensteinin', he was realizin' he was dyin'
And he needed a trick tryin' to bring him back to life
But that's magic, right?
But now you're cadaver bruh ('cadabra)
That's your [?] all the theatrics in ya rappin'
Camera trickin' like you snappin'
Take two of ya hot bars, we give 'em direct action
You start overreactin', this is a fact
He even try to reel it in to persuade them to tell you to bring it back
It was hot, but wasn't slick enough to go over nobody head, Permy relax
Ay look, I don't know about the people
But here's why I don't believe you
'Cause how you Vegan, but in ya Showtiming you talkin' 'bout you 'bout to let the beef brew?
And in the ring you one of a kind Verb, nobody hot as you
Wait so you a custom model (Cus D'Amato)
Good, I'm Iron Mikes, I got a box for you
You got a lot of niggas sayin' I ain't got enough to rock witchu
Well you gon' die a critic with them lyin' right on top of you
Ay, diacritic letters got a line right on top of 'U'
My last three, John Cruise through 11 and 0
Beat me? Mission Impossible
Keep it tall, you just lookin' to get a round (around)
But I'm too steep of an obstacle
Y'all think I took Buddy outta Love?
Murphy's Law, you wasn't thinkin' logical
Son, I only took you for this check, I adopted you
I'm raw, y'all lookin' at it backwards
You want the battle, I want the war, it's different rational
Like now we see Captain Marketable to private
So my arm forced to add morale
We different to the core (corp) in general, I got nothin' to prove
I black my ops, you Navy Seal, you just come from the blue
I changed the playin' fields, I rank way above all you dudes
Think chlorine, if you want this war to (water) change just be number one in the pool
Verb you a stupid fuck
When I gotta take niggas to school it's bad news
'Cause I be tearin' all the pupils up
Verb, you know when you hear bad news it be tearin' all them pupils–
Look, Mook a superhero, stage rip
Mention me and beef, the stakes (steaks) lift
If battle rap dyin', I let this cape flip and save shit
Lift the whole culture, make the climate on the plain shift
So fuck bein' grateful, I'm the nigga you need to thank bitch
Easy!

What can I say to the great Murda Mook?
Nothin'
'Cause he's the reason we here
Whoever your favorite battle rapper is…
He's the reason that we picked this career
He's the reason that battle rap used to have that chill back then
But he's also the reason that battle rap is gettin' held back still
Before I do this, I challenge you to this throne, young prince T'Challa
Nigga FUCK yo legacy
Nigga FUCK yo honor
Nigga FUCK yo god stuff
Let's see how tough y'all Black Panther is once he get stripped of his powers
Nigga meet yo Killmonger
I have no fear of ya
All the blood I shed in my career was for this moment
I'm a warrior, I pull up in my opponent's city solo
With hot iron loaded and I go drill somethin'
We ain't the same, look at yo battles
You stayed in yo region and had Hot, Iron, Loaded and never killed nothin'
But they say this a big rich town, KATAP!
Target practice at y'all James St. Patrick who not active
And still gettin' praise from all his past shit
Follow me y'all
On Power, that bitch Angela symbolizes the industry
She tries to tell him, ""Turn your back on them Ghost.""
She want you to leave this shit alone and sell an image of hope
But I'm his brother Tommy
I'm tryin' to tell him, ""Nigga we don't fit in wit' them folks.""
Wake up Mook, we battle rappers
Every line we sell dope, in our raps we shell folks
While you at the party witcha wrist froze
With Busta Rhymes and the Flipmode
We out here goin' to war, twin .45's: Donovan Mitchells
Takin' rounds from each other that feel like blows from the Klitschkos
While you drink Dom as you sip Mo'
We out here puttin' in work lettin' clips blow
I done shot my own brothers
Point blank range and watched they shit 'splode
While you cross the street, scared to squeeze and shakin' in this pose
You not one of us
Who you bring on your podcast? NOT ONE OF US
Who you refer when Dame Dash made a film? NOT ONE OF US
You the godfather of this shit
This how you gon' do yo' children?
Nigga you built this buildin'
The roof collapse, you just moved and said ""Fuck the new tenants.""
For the approval of these stars?
Aww dummy, you just that lil' nigga wit bars
Open ya eyes Mook, let me paint this picture of who you are
See you're just a python
And when it's time to throw a mouse in yo face
These industry niggas crowd around your cage wit they pretty gold chains
They watch you eat the mouse, then they clap so amazed
And then they go back to they rich lives
And leave yo silly ass trapped in that cage
Nigga you want acceptance
We bang our shit, nigga we set trip
You selfish
You want us to stay at the bottom like all the shellfish
Yeah you sell tix to come see you rap
But we don't care inside
When you're back we can't stand up for you, the culture paralyzed
You cripled 'em
You tell 'em one number and then you triple them
Death comes in threes, this yo 3rd match, swing on that pendulum
This that old Verb, who tactical and masterful and magical
Time to take this shit back, let's get retractable
I didn't have the drive for this shit but you changed my spark plugs
I'm a rider, I took out animals
Me and them St. Louis niggas, we took the boat Noah's Ark
And turned that bitch to a car club
You delusional, if this was the School of Heart, at graduation when Mook walk, only the flutes would blow
For Verb this gon' get musical
I'ma make this execution beautiful
This is history, you gon' be the first nigga that crack you and do it smooth, you know
But you the first man alive who sold tickets to his own funeral
What's up patna?
Time we peel the layers back like when you burn the toast
Gloves on wit the mask, let's get surgical
Shoulder strap over the arm, how man purses go
Shell project horizontal and send 'em vertical
In the ring wit Verb it's gon' be lines (lions) everywhere
You better learn the ropes
Fuck tryin' to pen wit me, bitch nigga, you better learn the joke
I gave you this home game to exchange verses bro
'Cause if I killed you outta town it's all business
But if you smoke a nigga in his house that shit is personal
Ay, he tried to tell me I'm in some shit like I'm scared
See what he tried to do was stop my mind from movin'
But I'm wit the shit so being in some shit means nothin'
My nigga I been in every kind of sewer
And I learned to love it and became a connoisseur
To St. Louis I'm Obama to 'em
I terminate the Terminators, I'm John Connor to him
Razor blade all in his face, I'll put a comma through him
He don't want this smoke, this shit embalmin' fluid
When I rap I get comets movin'
When you rap niggas get bored (board), how Dennis Rodman do it
I can turn him up or do it calm and suit ya
How you want it? Either way you are fucked
These rounds tonight like Kama Sutra
No fuckin' around before this fight, like how the boxers do it
Y'all Zab Judah, watch how I Kosta Tszyu him
Bring the cocky out him, get his posture ruined
Floyd/Pacquiao take punches, how can I not go through him?
Give a nigga a shot he'll put a hot one through ya
Fuck ya, I ain't star-struck, pussy
Let these new niggas pay homage to you
It's time to eat I'ma go noodles like a college student
Your streak I'ma end dat (in debt) like a college student
For the record I'm layin' the beat down, but I'm not producin'
You ain't wit the toxic, stop it Mooky
It's monsters where I'm from, I live through
Yo mama wouldn't even let you watch this movie
A lot to do wit drums movin', snares poppin' like rock acoustics
This Dr. Seuss shit vers' the Constitution?
Man, I ain't here to praise him tonight, now ask me why
(Why?!)
'Cause don't god gotta be good to you first before you hallelujah?
That's how I'ma do ya

But it's an opportunity bro, these Summer Madnesses
But I ain't got all your cabbage.""

You rap like you inebriated, here's why I know (wino) nigga
Verb, what's up wit all the slurs and the mumblin'
Tr-tryin' to get out bars, you stumblin'
What was the purpose (porpoise) of a Flubberfin?
Ay, Ay (AA) punk don't tell me you gettin' drunk again

That's the first step that I'll admit
And trust me Chaz, I can haul it (alcoholic)
Hope you don't think a nine'll miss (anonymous)
Ay, how it feel bein' the designated guy to whip?
Ya peeps grievin', see you sleepin' in pee, stinkin' while you sip
Oh you some kinda friend, you got me fucked up
Don't wanna question my drive and test my lines
Like if I point nine (.09) I ain't blowin' it
That's a breath of lies (breathalyz-er)
Ay, this different here man
We wake up wit headaches when you rhyme
Rubbin' our temples wanna forget you
'Cause you bottom-shelf and all ya boo's (booze) is 100% proof
Ay this steel (distill) is what you call a licker (liquor)
I thought shorty knew, you get a Glock 19, 40 too (1942)
Watch how you talk to killers (Tequilas)
They whine (wine) and bitter, battle nigga tender
Can't bare (beer) admittin' that I'm more G
Defend a bender (fender bender)
Bar hop and mention these rounds on me, that's whiskey business
How your dumb ass fought me for gettin' you off the concrete?
See I meant (cement) to put you six feet in it
He on Twitter dissin' Omar Epps all night, you brawl light
Just 'cause he root for me
You shouldn't put ya racks up if ya bra tight
But unlike you that kid a computer whiz, he the smart type
'Cause he learned his lesson
You a fool thinkin' he gonna go against God twice
Oh Verb nigga, I heard nigga that you a herb nigga
Bird nigga, pick up the burner, bullets burn niggas
Heard niggas submerge in him, then they turn in him
Curve in him, stuck in his sternum, they stern in him
Surgeon and all of his nurses they concerned for him
Murmurin', ""No savin' Verb,"" now they confirmin' him
Comatose, ay I got ya daughter home alone
She real spazzin' and I'm laughin'
'Cause she askin', ""Where my daddy? Why he can't return?""
I told that little bastard, the ER is where you are (UR)
Well let me give it to y'all St. Louis accent
I bet you wishin' you was h(ER)e with h(UR)r
I see the broke spirit in your mirror Verb
Seven years of worst, straight up bad luck
We saw Rex break his ass up
Shine zipped the bag up
Half A Gallon took all the ounces out ya tank to gas up
You got worked by a dirt Smurf named Twork
Off his name alone you shoulda known you supposed to shake his ass up
Man, did you really believe that they believed you was gonna succeed as the winner?
You think this league'll (legal) aid you wit gettin' Murda?
You buggin' nigga, you a public defender
I saw the pretender addin' a buncha them niggas under his Twitter
Tryin' to superhero to form against me like the fuckin' Avengers
I'm the real, they knows (Thanos) and I'm stone cold
And gon' let (gauntlet) reality be my decision to shape
And I ride despite a man (Spider-Man) died
'Cause this appear (disappear) that you dissin' a great (disintegrate)
Verb, you know when you disappear you disintegrate
Ay, I passed ARP, he one I blame too
Take this L, Jackson, you ain't a Marvel captain
To be honest, we still tryna figure out why he paid/paged you
Even on a break too
I hit a clear lane to the bucket, man it's disgustin'
It's like I mistimed my jumpin'
How I'm spazzin' on Mr. Duncan (dunkin')
He in his interview soundin' grumpy
""Why Mook want all this money?""
Is you serious? Well since you curious
It's 'cause I'm like a lower case 'i', top of the fuckin' line, period
That's why my capital type major
Look at the keyboard, watch
You see the power is at the top, I makes a lot (salat)
This Llama lake him (assalamualaikum)
Why would I lie (Allah)?
I'm sorta cocky 'cause my aura got me (origami) foldin' a lot of paper
I divide ya sweetie pie
She said her's the number that I should favor
But I said nah, 'cause bottom line, we ain't have nothin' in common to nominate her (denominator)
So fuck it I gotta–, nah, I'm not a hater
Plus I heard she a hard sucker
So muhfucka I save her for Now & Later
I came back a hour later
On wool sheets I put his baby to sleep (sheep), you know Murda
She whispered in her ear ""the greatest""
And the GOAT heard her (herder)
She told that nigga bye (baaah)
Put V to the side, but you already know that
'Cause I'm greater than
So she figured the GOAT is who she need to go at
Man, split it down the middle, that's a riddle
While you unfold that, I unload a whole MAC in ya gold caps
Player, I'm the coach, I help to press (depress)
If anyone of the pro's act (Prozac)
Yeah I'm feelin' myself like I don't know where my phone at
The waist where the chrome at
BAOW where ya dome at
You wanna smell a body? I think I can loan (cologne) that
You said New York niggas bias—you see now liar?
They want you to win, it's just you can't slip that bullshit by us
Our heart authentic, we don't rent it
Don't you even try to lend (Len) Bias
NY ain't ya habitat, everybody know that's a fact
Open ya phone, even Siri will (cereal) tell you
You ain't a nigga that the Apple Jack
Mook a superhero stage rip
Mention me and beef, the stakes (steaks) lift
If battle rap dyin', I let this cape flip, save shit
Lift the whole culture, make the climate on the plain shift
So fuck bein' grateful, I'm the nigga you need to thank bitch
Easy!

[Round 2: Aye Verb]
When you battled Lux, you beat Lux, straight up, no shade wit it
It's all fair when it's war
The way you won just wasn't quite my style, you played different
You took Lux secret diss record to Bus' and got it played nigga?
Oh, where I'm from that's called straight snitchin
It's ironic you the first good schoolboy I've met without great principle
I'm from the hood, I guess I'm raised different
Example: I got enemies that I know for a fact shot at niggas I slapped fives wit, but I take it to the grave wit me
Dot Mobb, how y'all develop a squadron
Wit a leader who got gelatin in his posture?
The number one rule of war is keep it silent
No snitchin', no women or children, if it's problems?
Only a coward believes any and every element is an option
Nigga save that bang bang shit, nigga we know player
Dot Mobb, you fuck wit us, yeah we locate 'em
I love my niggas-
(Look at him, he emotional!)
I love my niggas so them not favors
Shoot one of mine I shoot back, give 'em a bag and relocate 'em
You the rookie, you don't see no stages
You just Markelle Fultz but on the flo' nigga he's no Tatum
Are y'all kiddin' me holmes?
Do y'all listen to the lyrics of what this nigga be on?
I motivate the block, rocks in yo hand, young nigga get on
When he talks rock in yo hand it's silly shit like Infinity Stones
Gun down our president, I'ma be known
Like the nigga that got Kennedy gone
I'm good, money, the city's capitol, Italy, Rome
In the room it may feel like you winnin', bitch listen
On cam, my opponents don't even know that they dead
I Sixth Sense 'em
I'm conscious, but I go back and forth, I'm switch flippin'
Behind mine, yo words don't even sound the same, ya pitch shiftin'
Fuck this, unlimited rounds, they DID book me for a long time
Fuck a preview, let's let that beef brew, in 3D too
(So it's Showtime!)
I told my bitch we ain't celebratin' shit, we go mama
Itinerary, kill him we skatin', we roll bouncin'
Hollow-points all in the .40 look like I load mountains
Y'all best pound for pound 'bout to get drug
And broken down into whole ounces
You an old vulture in a roll-out chair
An old voucher and that boy Mook a whole ho outchea
Yo, you ride for the minds of these niggas that play with Legos
I'm crazy wit it, I'll stick a fork in ya noodle
Twist it, pull it back and then lick the Prego
Straps I stay wit one, Mook, a nigga faithful
Don't judge me, I come from hammers bangin'
And white folks yellin' ""Case closed!""
I'll get yo bitch snatched, not where her waist go
Pesos, wanna get the bitch back? Then bring a case load
A body bag is what you prayin' fo'
But a dog fight is what I'm paid fo'
When it's war I don't play bro
I'm up early throwin' rounds in that toaster: Leggo my Eggo
Yo rhyme faces don't match yo vibrations
When it's over you gon' be sour, don't cry baby
With great power comes responsibility
In yo tainted mind, the odds of killin' me
Was equal to the arms of centipedes
But I'm too cold, you can't see me like the winter's leaves
Thank me later, 'cause you losin' if you don't lose
And check the files, every winner bleeds
After tonight the biggest three
Gon' be me first, Lux here and since I'm bein' beatin' you
You gon' have to get in the middle of us, you must intervene
Nigga I will cave yo chest in
Slap box wit all your inner beings
You prolly rolled here in a limousine
Which is more than form fittin' for kings
Each time they get they wings
Nah, you ain't a king nigga, you's a pawn
And in real life nigga you's a corn
You try to say you different
And all the rest of us niggas is all in uniform
That's why I'ma put one in yo head since you the unicorn
I asked some street niggas 'bout John
They like, ""Who is the dude?""
You an actor, nobody remember you young like John Witherspoon
That's pops nigga
Top splittin', slot switchin' like I'm not spittin'
Fix yo face or get botched nigga
No, you are not one of the Wolves, you're not Wiggins
Sorry, gotta get rid of you son like Doc Rivers
How you not get it? I may win, I might lose
But when I fall I give the fans the feelin' of when Mike lose
I been past my test nigga, this night school
Nigga ya pen high school
You come back to the game wit the same moves every time like you Ken/Ryu
You a lil Loc wit this killin' Murda, you got Lorenz IQ
And I'm a Menace, I don't blend like you
Nigga I ride through Harlem on four [?]
Hangin' out the window wit a fully auto
All the bullies that I know they got spin cycle
Yo bitch nothin', only bitches who nothin' attract men like you
My dick get hard, I extend rifles
Boy I make yo' Bigfoot bitch blow me until her windpipe loose

{Crowd starts booing and loosing their shit}
Here come the hate. Here come the hate. It's NOTHING. Easy work. Here come the hate. Say no more. I love it. I love it

Now who believes hustle stories from y'all? Like y'all bleeders
If you catch runnin' spots, nigga we all cheaters (cheetahs)
Cannons, light up you and yo girl, we called Cheaters
I ain't here to play witchu dawg, this y'all recess
In this battle realm I'm looked upon as a reject
You know why? 'Cause I'm the only nigga sellin' heroin on this weed set
Breathe on 'em, why exhale?
I'm talkin' bars in a big boy fashion
I'm talkin' Big T in a five XL, wide as hell
You ain't known for rhymin' well
So when you be okay you like a dirty nigga in a fresh tee and some Jordans, Mook, you look fly as hell

[Round 3: Murda Mook]
Now before we begin (vegan)
I'ma need them to get deep into this
'Cause y'all got me battlin' a nigga that don't even exist
You picked the name 'Verb'
The definition of that word mean action
But if action causes reaction you abstract, let's speak facts then
Pay attention to me captain
Listen to what I'm tellin' you
If your existence predicates off decisions you hypothetical
If I'm gettin' too much ahead of you
Well let me try helpin' you and gettin' it clear
The stage: matter, we can touch it, we can feel it, it's here
Now, I can run on it, jump on it, whatever one I wanna display
But until I decide what action I wanna take
A verb can never come into play
See this how I'm gonna renown (re-noun)
'Cause these rounds these crowds graspin'
But see, nouns we need Verb to add description to shit that's happenin', that's why I need you Verb
Because you help me manifest a lesson I wanna fulfill
That the only reason you existin'
Is because you position next to somethin' that's real
Do you feel? I'm on ya heels
This marble floor is versatile (vs a towel)
I shine off a pile of shit, different that I do
Sprints from flicks I get reviewed, businesses I get renewed
Parquet or park floor, I ain't picky when I choose
Fuck where the Surf is, if the turf switch
Then I guess Mike'll be skippin' to the Lou'
(JayBlac you better listen now!)
Ay, Mook, why you by yourself in the Wraith for? (Rafer)
Oh this an empty V (MTV) 'cause I'm Conceited now
Plus y'all know I'm used to whippin' Lux-ury
Why y'all got me pushin' this bum-ass V around?
Of course, you my brother
I tried to open these doors for Surf
Who the fuck told you you could ride?
Now it was in vain (vein) takin' that risk (wrist) pushin' Tsu aside (suicide)
Oh, and I hope you ain't think that you could hide
If you don't think that your parents let us know
Who are you inside, bruh you a lie
Like this created playa haircut and this beige thing on ya beard son
That just tell us all you do is dye (die)

{crowd starts booing}

Why you always callin' niggas ""ugly""?
You don't think that's weird son?
You even called me ugly, well I can be all that and some
But then here come my question, and I think it's a pretty fair one
If you think niggas is ugly
Well why don't you tell us what niggas you think is handsome?
Ay Verb, ay look, and in ya parking lot sprint-cident (sprint incident), I tried to get you against all of my man's son
I said, ""It's so hot up here son."" I mean yeah son
They caught the kid nappin', but if you look close
You see he tryin' to get money, that's why he ran some (ransom)
Chaz a bitch, tee-off on him like I had a lisp
Sound of a Tech-9, feel like Easter, I'm about to have a fit
You try to spin, get ya back caught
That's the way the god play
All I do is amaze (a maze) you gotta find out the hard way
Daylyt gave me a call say, ""Son (sun) this nigga 24 hours straight.""
I couldn't even take the shine for it, 'cause that was all Day
Wait, don't we got unlimited time for it? Oh we got all day
Ay, I'ma bang 'til this clip drop
This body a quick fix, you a pit stop
The way I'm snappin' on you, prolly got you in shock
I'm Bill Collector wit the fifth cocked
I'm 'bout to Showout wit a big knot
Strip you out ya socks, make you kick rocks in flip flops
Two bricks out the nick, five hours, six tops
I took trips with no stashes and the whip hot
You ever seen cops and almost had some shit dropped?
I took risks to let the bricks clot
I had six under me, twelve all on top of me, no tick tocks
Look, you need to blame ARP, he the one who did this to you
So we don't gotta discuss then (disgustin')
Why you was this pick-able (despicable)
Same nigga who said the white man trickin' you
Then with the dude, KOD just typical
I think we beyond sayin' (Beyonce) this nigga's a jiggaboo (Jigga boo)
Well I'm Hov in the elevator, I'm calm when shit gettin' tricky
I don't respond when little sissies try and kick it wit me
Wicky wicky, back when Smack recordin' was important
Missouri was sorta slow
Thought I could set (cassette) the table for him
But rewind, realize that time I was too fast for it (forward)
Pause it, aw shit, niggas you millennial
Picture you gettin' rid of Mook
You digital, my real (reel) is old school original
I ain't need the tool, I made the streets move
I had the people eager to see Mook
Make a scene, that was pre views
Fuck all the battle rappers who came to see me lose
Suck my dick, I hope all y'all kids die in preschool
Oh and you think I ain't peep you
All your rants that you ain't verified on Instagram
Listen man, give that shit up
They prolly e-mailed you and said, ""We'll give you a check…
Right after you get it from Lux.""
I know you saw him as an influence, but now turnin' vegan
Preachin' about all the wrongs men doin'
It ain't no accident, you wanted y'all collision that bad you turned into him
Ay, he gave you credit on the card when he rhyme
You asked to battle, he declined
But he already gave you rounds when he curved you three times
But speakin' on that night Verby
When I started his career, let's tell it right Verby
I knew you from nobody (no body)
And went out on a limb and saved you from arms and feet
Shoulda let you get tore so (torso) we coulda seen Vegan Verb vegetable since you are what you eat
But my smarts they elite, listen hard it get deep
Let me soul a (solar) system, this is when you and I verses (universes) meet, a solid G (astrology)
Would I be goin' too far if I said you are only a star 'cause of me?
Alright, when my consolation (constellation)
Be the battle that let us all know who you are with SB
Son of a bitch that was me!
But see males and females
I was pushin' through my own agenda (gender)
Bitch nigga, the whole St. Louis owe a nigga
He don't think so, here go the picture
He was the first nigga from over there to come over here to battle rap
If you woulda got crippled like Hurricane
And they woulda got wind of that attack
We woulda torn they doe (tornado) up
Stormed out of New York, wouldn't have came back after that
That's a fact, imagine that
No rabbit hat, woulda never seen a Magic act
And Yung Ill catchphrase woulda never had that impact
He woulda hit Beasley to come through as a spitta
And ""Who is this nigga?""
That woulda been the question he got back from Smack
Nick Cannon wouldn't know who Hitman is
And we woulda been hearin' 'bout who Hitman's hitman is
So yeah, take it personal
But if it wasn't for Murda Mook, Lux curvin' you
Woulda been the last time niggas heard the Lou'
But remember, we all remember that line
""Making his guardian angel duck""
Well I got my own guardian angel
And he told me yours ain't like that part you was sayin' too tough
That's why he not here to save you bruh
'Cause your guardian next to my guardian
Party Arty and they partyin' hard
Hardy hardyin' is watchin' me straighten you up
Ay, Verb, your bars is wack and ya lingo
I'll throw a hand grenade through ya baby window
Kill ya extended family with the same extendo
Small carrier in the pocket: that's a plane memento
But the Midwest movement, y'all was percolatin'
The ground workin' person put round on that circuit
Y'all was circulatin'
You Holla, Ill, RemyD, shit y'all birthed the nation
If you hollered ill (Holla, Ill)
Then RemyD (remedy) would be the first to aid him
But RemyD got Ill, tried to Holla at Verb to save him
Verb hollered ""Eww, nah RemyD, let the nurses take him.""
Then Ill needed remedy, needed–
But the Midwest movement, y'all was percolatin'
The ground workin' person put round on that circuit
Y'all was circulatin'
You Holla, Ill, RemyD, shit y'all birthed the nation
If you hollered ill then RemyD would be the first to aid him
But Remedy got ill, tried to holla at Verb to save him
Verb hollered ""Eww, not RemyD, let the nurses take him.""
Then Ill needed remedy, needed Holla and Verb replace him
They had an ill remedy for that: Holla and Verb replaced him
Now it's just Holla and Verb, prolly heard niggas, heard the hatin'
Still it's just absurd with the Holla and Verb debatin'
Turn the pages, now observe Holla and Verb on stages
Hollerin' verbs and phrases, a lot of disturbin' statements
On why they deserve the greatness
We ain't tear the Midwest down
Y'all know who the ones to blame is?
All y'all gotta do when y'all around, look in each other faces!
But speakin' of faces, you put a blindfold on yours against X Factor
What the fuck? Was that a phase?
You makin' up new card games?
Blindfoldin', wait, you combine poker wit playin' spades?
Bet, so when my man go to raise, you gon' hit the deck after
And he gon' leave you blind and folded on the stage
'Cause he my X Factor
You talk foul on these lines 'til the ref at ya
And if you try to argue the call, you gon' get a TEC (tech) after
But let's back up, 'cause if we speakin' of poker
I think with our careers, that's the game it relate to
Like to acknowledge the fact that I seen you I had to raise you
Let's put it on the table
I knew I had the winnin' hand before ARP revealed the card
I can say that wit a straight face too
Oh you straight boo, means a full house will call ya bluff
The king back shittin' on niggas: that's a royal flush
You wanna know how I do pussy niggas that be talkin' rough?
It ain't a tough call, I just smack the dog shit out
In front of niggas that call you tough
Or shatter your jaw up, put you in the surgery
'Cause I heard if it's glass you supposed to break in case of emergency
I can't believe they got me battlin this cornball
I'll put bread on this beef and get it handled with a stick, that's a corndog
Yo, you owe me money Verby, I ain't allowin' no debts to fester
Peel down ya neck, the best suppressers, oppress the pressure
The length of the shit I'm with (width) will prolly seem extra extra
It's tailor suited for a body
It's an addresser (a dresser) for desperate measures
Get him hemmed, license to kill, somethin' bright on the steel

Long, breathe easy pop, this is hip-hop
In the harm way, we do it the war way, all day
I never procrastinate (you shouldn't)
I'm from where the war games fascinate (you couldn't)
You wouldn't believe what they've been tellin' me
The perfect match is jail and me

And a mess out in Brooklyn, hi-ya

Uhh
That's some shit that that that niggas ain't even seen before
That's that shit
Motherfuckers ain't never seen nothing like this before
For real man
It's goin' down, baby, uh
Unh, Busta Rhymes
(WHAT!) Unh, DMX nigga
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh

[Verse 1: DMX]
I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still wanna get near me (Unh!), fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin' (What!), from the floor, to the ceilin'
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin' and stealin' (C'mon!)
'Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved (Unh!)
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard (C'mon!)
Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (Why?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit, then, why should I try? (Unh!)
See, plenty niggas die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good (Damn!)
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it wasn't enough (Uh-huh)
The Devil told me it would happen
But I kept callin' his bluff (Uh-huh)
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine, define, revolvin' doors (Nigga!)

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggas tell me (Why) tell me (We die)
'Cause we crazy with it (Hunh!), quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse
Let me ask my niggas (Why?)
My niggas, tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we Gods nigga (And) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggas (why?)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Unh, yo, they say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that, why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, ask God, ""Love me, please""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggas that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They wanna slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin'?
I was told I'd amount to nothin'
Most of my childhood life by folks that was stuntin' my growth
Separated me from the shit I was wantin' the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them O's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin to, erase my ghostses, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders
Tryin to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words, nigga, my will was weak
Please feel what I speak
This ain't your average ordinary jargon weak rap niggas be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, X, and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, 'til we meet, niggas

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
'Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse (Ha!)
Let me ask my niggas (why?)
My niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
Because we Gods, nigga (And) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet (Huh! Ha!)
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggas (why?)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your FUBU sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin'
On a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for
With every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
The demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
For my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin' in your steppin' faggot, nigga
'Cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin'
Real niggas in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin' me to rep for the better, and carry on
Something great and keep a nigga name livin' forever
Now tell me!

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
'Cause we crazy with it (Hunh!), quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse
Let me ask my niggas (Why?)
My niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
Because we Gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga (Ha!)
Because I walk the ground under my feet (Hunh!)

Can you see, see, see, see
What's in store for you, for you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
Yo, right before I lay your soul to sleep
Witness the day of your wreckin' and with God on the street
Behold, what the fuck y'all niggas come around here for
We massacre the masses so therefore
Here's your, invitation to explore
The way we gather up niggas to thoroughly rep for
My street niggas, c'mon
Stressed niggas, c'mon
Hungry niggas,  c'mon
Yes, yes y'all,  c'mon
Hope my live motherfuckers pass the test y'all
Prepare for high retribution, and I hope God bless y'all (bless y'all)
Fuck shit up and watch the truth manifest y'all (fest y'all)
Feel it in your guts and the burnin' in your chest y'all (chest y'all)
Pushin through just like a wild flood
With such a pain that's so intense it make y'all wanna cry blood
My slang talk earned a scholarship, from how to style a chick
Influence rulership and earn another dollar quick (quick)
You need to do the philosophical research
Fuck around and be the next to die you better leave first
Yo, my whole crew extra large, stay charged
Like polytheism havin' belief in many gods
I gotta handful of niggas with a sick disease
Die close to destructive anti-social tendencies
Yo, turn up the treble just a level
Analyze the science deeper than when Musa symbolized the devil
Now let me ask y'all

Can you see, see, see, see
What's in store for you, for you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Ha, all hell break loose
Yo, we fight to the end and never call for a truce
Y'all niggas better pick and choose and select the battles wisely
Always with the same approach and never once surprised me
Ha, however how clever
Niggas is fighting for mad cheddar
Yo, cold like the wind blow in the winter
Make you remember the torture like the frostbite that bit off your finger
This Means War, I said it before
Adrenaline rush, heart beat rapid, sweat wet up the floor
Try to threat and wanna battle me nigga
I'ma show you the major difference between a dream and reality nigga
Yo, then I continuously hype up a nation
Huddle with my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
And analyze how many niggas gon lose
Tryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
And analyze how we was needed to live
Carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative
Pass this to all my seeds after me
Represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be
The economy has been at it's best, to all my niggas hungry
Let's keep weavin' and magical methods of makin' money
So I'ma rep at my fullest, you can't spark me
And fight the hardest in the grim current state of Anarchy

[Verse]
Though some of us have been poisoned
Many of us have been blessed
And through the worst shit
That we all as people go through
Every blessing that we are blessed to have
Are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
And makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
Everything and every motherfucker gets dealt with accordingly
Mark my words
See I remember on The Coming album
You know when there was only five years left
It was once said that there was no time
To take time for granted
Well we are now face to face with that very given time
There's only one year left motherfuckers
1999
The dawn of the new millennium
I understand though
Sometimes it takes time
And hands-on extreme hardship experience
To realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
By all means
It will always be better to be safe than to be sorry
So as we finally approach the year 2000
Behold what it might have in store for us people
There have been many indications of changes
That will occur, that has already occurred
That were not and will not be set up to our benefit, as people
But in order for us to continue to build
We must destroy
And unfortunately in the process
Many of us will be liable candidates
Of being destroyed
But in the bigger scheme of things we must defend
What we all collectively identify with as the truth
And with what is right
To all my live soldiers
And all my live women
Those who may not survive the turning point
May you forever rest peacefully
As you are delivered back to the essence
So I dedicate this burial song to all of you
To my survival of the most fit for real niggas
And women no doubt
Continue to get what's yours from out this fucker
Before your time run out
And may the force of survival forever rest with y'all
My live motherfuckers
To all my survivalists
See you in the next thousand year period
Allah bless all y'all
Flipmode continue to bounce
Like a satellite in orbit
Seein' all you motherfuckers at every angle
The imperial, the universal, powerful Flipmode squad
Stay tuned
See y'all motherfuckers, January 1st 2000
