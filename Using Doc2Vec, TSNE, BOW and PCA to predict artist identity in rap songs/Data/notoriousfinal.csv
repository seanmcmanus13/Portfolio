Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

[Verse 1]
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews, hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G: believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Toting Tecs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Wait for niggas to step up on some fighting shit
We get hype and shit and start lighting shit
So step away with your fist-fight ways
Motherfucker, this ain't back in the days
But you don't hear me though

[Chorus]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

Things done changed on this side

Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

[Verse 2]
No more coco-levio 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3... all it is to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfucking chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrapping
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

[Chorus]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

[Verse 3]
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eating 5 cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Going out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the 9 and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts
Every time I turn around, a nigga getting took out
Shit, my Momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed

[Chorus]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day

[Notorious B.I.G.]
My man Inf left a TEC and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?

[Young Biggie]
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

[Notorious B.I.G.]
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

[Young Biggie]
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, ""It's so hard.""

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yes, love—love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

[Young Biggie]
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

[Young Biggie]
Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

[Notorious B.I.G.]
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, (yeah, nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel

[Young Biggie]
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

[Young Biggie]
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it

Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

Damn, is that the Chronic?
Yeah, it's that chronic boy

[Verse 1]
So you wanna be hardcore with your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who, says me the lyrical
Niggas saying, ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

[Chorus]
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

[Verse 2]
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this?
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the (blue suits)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby

[Chorus]
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

[Verse 3]
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
""What's love got to do...""
When I'm ripping all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I’m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I’ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don’t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn’t matter: skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed:
I’m guaranteed to fuck her ’til her nose bleed
Even if your new man’s a certified mack
You’ll get that H-Town in ya: you want that old thing back

[Hook: Faith Evans & Biggie]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past: let’s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain’t frontin’
They don’t call me big for nuttin’ all of a sudden

I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, ""What you talking 'bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...

...T-H-O-D Man, here I am

Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
And it goes a little something like this

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it

Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental

I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and

I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G. & Method Man]
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my MAC unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
(I got more Glocks and TECs than you)
I make it hot (niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

[Verse 1]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

[Verse 2]
I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeep's
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch, swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

[Verse 3]
I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle

Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows

No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me

Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends

Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's going to be a bad boy""

On the drug scene, fuck a football team:
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Peep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping

Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week

I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you

Bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing
They know Big be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q
45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to

It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies

Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
(Get a hold of yourself, nigga!)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red
(It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe
(Yo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
(Nigga, talk to me please, man!)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
(Yo, I'ma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
(Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone
(Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)

Low riders, D.O.C., loc
Instead they got me battlin' Ray Swag and we all know that he choke
Bitch cut all this tough talk, don't be the one mark
He said, ""I'm so used to the shot I just gotta hear it and I can tell what it is by the gun spark.""
Nigga you dumb smart
A west coast nigga with gun smarts
But ya son in school gettin' asked, ""What's 2 + 2?"" Fuck he in class puttin' up 1 fo'?
But then again that's 1 fo'
14 shots to the body that's one fo'
I took the .44 off Hova now that got me with one fo'
Look at punk ass Geechi and his family with all these fem' gestures
Should I chin check him or bench press him?
Silencer over the silencer so you ain't gon' be able to call a shot all you gon' feel is the wind pressure
You on Twitter sayin' 9's known for jammin' tryin' to put the shame on niggas
Old school so when you said, ""the 9's jam"" I was like, ""Yeah NBA Jam they bang on niggas.""
Told y'all in 2012, Bill Collector, they bang on niggas
Reverse that to collect a bill I bang on
I wanna see you die in the worst way
Funeral, hearse 'play
After I kill you I can't stop, I kill ya family dirty on Thursday
Slit ya mother throat, drown your grandmother on her church day
Walk in ya kid's school and let it sing, I'm tryin' to celebrate they birthday
Two pistols, to keep 'em quiet I got two tennis balls on the end like a cripple I'm usin' a walker
If I don't slow it down or translate it, two racks, you tennis ball I don't do drive bys I'm usually the walker
And take it a step further, I'm tryin' to keep it non violent
But if granny keep hollerin' she gon' force the blunt force trauma and
Weapon of choice I'm usin' her walker
I can never die if you kill me it's Night King now I'm fused with The Walkers
I can't stand ya creep ass
Botox, fake bitch I see past ya cheap ass
Cocaine cartel I seek cash
Punchin' others faster than a Mayweather speed bag
D.A. rush in? I'm hidin' in the bathroom wall like Miguel Rodriguez
You on Twitter committing foul actions
I'll let the cal' blast him
If he don't die durin' the ambulance ride, then somethin' gon' go wrong at the hospital like a malpractice
Who gon' ride?
Turn this into a huntin' game, I pick you to die
Road kill, you jumped in front of that car that's deer suicide
Light the crib up, everybody in that bitch get crucified
The Uzi connected to a string, the string hangin' around my neck
I'm a Champion, we got a suit and tie
Niggas is pussy, online eatin' gangsta cookies
But soon as you try to take them to school they play hookie
I play the N.E.R.D.s this shit can get for real (Pharrell) if you push me
It force me to bring the A.R. in the building like a white boy that's bein' bullied
You good with words Gotti, I let a cap spray
Plus I can handle a Verb better than Pat Stay
O.B.C. how about I say I catch you early like a matinee?
No, I don't even hop out the car
I shoot through the window, bangin' the hand off the steering wheel like I'm havin' bad day
Shut the fuck up! Pull that lil' deuce deuce, go 'head buck up
You aimin' it wrong
A false move and ya luck up
I'm sick of you pussy ass niggas actin' tough tough
I'm from Philly, ain't no Bloods and Crips but the wrong jersey will get you fucked up
What is it? Gangsta gally? You the Cali king? They got your pictures on fliers?
I guess it's easy to be the Cali king when your only competition is Danny Myers
The sad part? You couldn't even handle Myers
Metal with the grip with the rubber on hand like a pair of pliers
Round one

[Round Two: Geechi Gotti]
Aye I apologize for the contract. He gotta rap too it ain't my fault. He gotta rap

Serious question my nigga, this is somethin' I've been contemplatin'
Battle rap Mount Rushmore, how come you ain't never in that conversation?
But niggas be thinkin' about the greats like Mook, Lux, Ars', Hollow, how come they ain't never mention your name?
Cause you a bum, you couldn't cover them spots if you was-
Man you act would go to somethin'
If this was basketball you wouldn't be MJ, Kobe, Lebron or even Dunkan
More like AC Green
(Why's that?)
You really known for fuckin' nothin'
Stop fuckin' frontin', talkin' 'bout you the king of Philly
You ain't Gilly, you ain't AR Ave
You ain't Kaboom, you ain't Reed, you ain't Meek or Cass'
When niggas think about the top niggas in Philly ain't nobody gon' say yo' ass
And durin' this ass whoopin' ain't nobody gon' save yo' ass
You ain't had a hot bar ever, you lucky they even paid yo' ass
Pinocchio, this Geppetto, this the nigga that made yo' ass
We know you wasn't runnin' no trap, you barely gettin' money from rap
Talkin' 'bout, ""I be bustin' those dope moves""
Nigga you wouldn't be Fresh if it wasn't for Smack
Now here goes some facts
You all jokes, no bars
So as for substance, as the crowd can see it really ain't much
You perform good as a muhfucka, but you don't be talkin' 'bout shit, like you don't really say much
That's why it makes sense why ya name Tech 9 (N9ne), cause I can see the holes in ya makeup (make up)
W-w-why you gotta rap like that?
Y-y-you should fuckin' chill
Til you get pistol whipped and forget ya shit, nigga now you gotta stutter for real
What the fuck is the deal?
I've been to jail and I've been to college
See both situations, only my mama put money on them books
So don't judge a book cause it ain't all what it seems
Cause I done know niggas who got shot and niggas with degrees
See I could've got life or I coulda been a lawyer
Bro, I swear to God I'm a criminal who actually played both sides of the fence
You wouldn't find a fairer con (Farrakhan)
Ain't you a Muslim, right?
Ain't ya name Hakeem?
See you don't really want beef
I can give you plenty reasons why
Hakeem you should've never took this so who ever allowed you on (Olajuwon) see you die
Rockets shit, Nina out, small talk, I'm just poppin' shit
You see these Glocks and shit?
Extendos lookin' like moppin' sticks
On Compton Crip a head shot will have stitches laced to the top like boxin' kicks
[?] don't dap me nigga I'll pull up on a bitch who had you and get nasty wit' her
Meanin' I'll put a Tech 9 in ya mama and disappear, same way your daddy did
All you rap is filler, Jerry killed you and he wasn't even at his best nigga
Now you got Gotti, this ain't ya first time dyin' to a west (Wess) nigga
I stretch niggas, I done laid plenty to rest
This a new era, I don't give a fuck about any of the vets
Especially you, more known for ya talkin' then ya ballin', you Kenny ""The Jet""
Head shot after head shot, that's what I'm finna do
They gon' fine ya body laid out in the street after I'm done killin' you
Coroners ain't even want to pick cuz up, so Tech (texts) was left on scene like when a bitch ain't feelin' you
I'm from Nutty Blocc I don't give a fuck where your peoples from
I'm a Packer's fan so I really didn't a fuck when the Eagles won
I want all the smoke, nigga Cheech & Chong
I hope you got a strap cause in Cali, you better keep you one
I told Beasley I wanted a Math problem but he gave me this cheap old bum
So I'ma put this nine over 9 and see if it can equal one
Knock him down and stand over the body and let the tool squirt
Two shots, baow, baow, tell Mama Tech her baby dead yeah the truth hurts
Another shot, BA-...aw this bitch jammed
Oh well I didn't need the third round; I'm Tsu Surf
DNA: Bodybag
Goodz: Bodybag
That nigga Bill Collector put your body bag in a body bag
You done been killed a gang of times before you even met me
They done ran out of body bags, after this we just gon' put him in a Hefty
And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
Your turn, see if you can make them niggas believe them lies

[Round 2: Tech 9]
So you really gon' shoot my mother while she warmin' up some peas and shit?
And y'all really believe that shit?
Bay Loc, the Compton Crip that be squeezin' shit
I got rights so it's best if I just plead the fifth
And say nothin', cause if I do I'ma squeeze the clip
You from Nutty Blocc
Me? I'm from the other block
Strapped down, dump and peel, that the nutty block
If we don't catch you on the first go round, we send another shot
Then spin another block
Gotti don't know where to run, I got a car comin' down and a car comin' up the block
He in the middle of the street, you hear another shot
My shooter send another shot
Heavy handed bartender, he get a double shot
Why you actin' gangsta Gotti? You ain't no fuckin' goon
He shot niggas, did he? Stop treatin' me like I'm fuckin' Lou'
We can do this the quiet way or the loud way, you hear the gun go BOOM
Pull the Desert out, the E's will drop him like he heard it from another room
I said you was a rappin' star, but you rap with your head down and the wolves will eat you for lunch
You got better but I'm not flattered, you ain't thank me enough
I came in L.A., motorcycle like, ""Aye cuz where the fuck is the plug?""
Parked on Crenshaw, then Gotti stole my bike, see he playin' too much
I said you rap with your head down, I wasn't tryin' to play you for chump
Well since Baby Boy wanna steal bikes, now he gotta rap with his head up while y'all wait for the punch
You shavin' dirt
I want my money back or your dame get murked
Or I can shoot her in the neck or the blade will work
If you played Captain Save A Hoe the stainless burst
Stab an ice pick in ya eye then rerun it across your face like it's my favorite shirt
That line was naaah, used that sloppy
Could I have used it a better way? Probably
Let me rewind that line back, copy
Gem star to your neck then rerun it across your face it look like I'm playin' air hockey
Streets Of Rage, I can hit him with the ax or he can meet the blade
Hunter with this thunder right now it's time to stop the microwave
Of course I love wrestling bars, I'll get you Rock'ed slam
Shawn Michaels with the kick, I got a hot hand
These Dudley Brothers, one lift you in the air and the other put you through a table
I'm a beast, married to that white girl, call her Sable
Bitch where, Roman Reigns you get your shit spared
North Carolina/Detroit, T-Top to Tee Grizzley, I brought a big bear
A new day for this Uso I'll let a clip air
Two AR's got me walkin' like Ric Flair
I came in this game filled with stars, I'm talkin' VCR's
The Chinese spot, everything we spit was raw
I've been in tough battles, my resume is built with scars
Gotti you ain't nothin' but a cash register so I treat you like a cashier and tuck one under like the bill too large
I'm back on Smack it's time for my Ascension
Ready for the bullshit so miss me with the detention
Layin' on a roof is the only time I'm crawlin' for position
You sell hair so you should be used to these extensions
Gotti I thought you was a real one
You said you had six months to a year in jail and you came home in two weeks
Sheesh
I don't know what type of deal you cut, man that shit was sweet
They confronted you with jail time unless you turned informant, made you squeak
Southside Compton Crip huh?
No wonder they got you out here tellin' on the nephews like [?]
I'll put 18 through your wheel, the dawgs on it
You hop out and try to run, I'm all on it
Catch him at the end of the trailer and then I pull it
{Beasley voice} Although we do this for sport, it is not a game
He got hit with a Beasley bullet
Call it quits
If I make change it's for the Parliament
I got .40 cents in my hand and I'm spendin' all of it
I want your baby mother, I heard she was a baller bitch
So I can stuff her in a black trash bag, that's how you ball a bitch
You'se a Beverly Hills rapper
Ain't no murders down there
You keep your doors locked for what? Ain't no burglars down there
Come to Philly, you fuck around and get murdered down there
Talkin' beef, turn his body to burger down there
Talk is cheap, we take it a step further down there
Not Geechi man but Gucci Man, the clip go blllet blllet burn down there
You bird nigga
Round 2

[Round 3: Geechi Gotti]
Aye this nigga got his mans right here tellin' you the words the whole time and shit
{laughs}
And then you rap for like ten minutes wastin' niggas time and shit
Tryin' to play me for a snitch, man that shit wack
In Cali them type of accusations will get you bitch slapped
Real rap, but I heard Tech a legend
I say, ""A legend for what? Cause he beat Miles?""
Nigga what that mean to a nigga that beat trials?
Free my nigga Doggy and Baby Wood, my bros on that fo' yard
Say they livin' through me, so I ain't got no choice but to go hard
See I coulda been killed, if it wasn't for rappin'
Still duckin' them shots from guns that's clappin'
They say my life like a movie
I say this shit couldn't be comedy cause I wasn't laughin'
And when them niggas came through shootin' clips and my patnas died on the scene, that wasn't actin'
Y'all remember Boyz N The Hood?
Ice Cube played Doughboy, that movie made him a star
But we in land of the gangbang, walk ups and drive bys
That wasn't the first time I seen a nigga let the tre (Trey) out the car
True story, I hate it when they say cause we grew up in the hood we hopeless
Nigga that's a damn lie cause I remember goin' to school and my teachers used to be like, You can be whatever you want, you don't gotta be this thug guy.""
I said, ""I know. I believe anything is possible. Shit yesterday I seen some slugs fly.""
Now listen, When Doves Cry, see growin' up, that song ain't make a lot of sense
Til my patna got cracked for a murder cause he ain't had gloves on That's when I realized you can actually learn a lot from prints (Prince)
Now I've been pissed, off for a minute
Cause y'all remember I asked a mama what hurt more; givin' birth or buryin' him?
She told me it was givin' birth, now that answer threw me to the left
She said cause she never planned on bein' pregnant but the way that nigga was livin' she was already plannin' for his death
Now this lifestyle will have a nigga stressed
Like the condom broke in a hoodrat
My biggest fear, is gettin' smoked by a nigga who was just askin' where the woods at
True story, that's why I'm never slippin', it's forever grippin'
Two straps, one nine, one revolver, the code word: Red Lobster
(What the fuck that mean?)
You will get this before the meal, it's a cheddar biscuit
The Metal Twisted, but it's not a game
I hold it like this cause I don't need the aim
BAOW, put this clown head on fire he Needles Kane
The heat'll bang, they told me, if they ain't ridin' for you, then what the fuck you doin' wit' 'em?
I sent a prayer up to Spittage, he told me to tell you stop sayin' his name before the battles if you gon' be losin' in 'em
Stupid nigga
My cousin Wicked got hit when that Tec jammed; true story
I'm just glad he live to tell about it
My patna got shot in his couch, left stankin' in the house
I seen his grandma she said she still can't get the smell up out it
You gotta have the stomach for this
I digress cause seein' my niggas just die, that's hard to digest
But I guess, we done been to enough jails
Even blindfolded we can sketch out the cell pattern
This the gangland where niggas die, rags cover the coughin' (coffin) like we well mannered
My niggas hit me everyday like, ""Gotti what's up? I'm glad you got out.""
Cause I'm one of the few niggas that understand a green dot is more important than a shoot out
My niggas be in there pissed off, thinkin' that niggas don't give a fuck about him like they must hate 'em
It be everyday I be gettin' frustrated wishin' I could just save 'em
Cause they write letters to niggas who won't even write back
The only letter they get is the one the judge gave 'em
And you think I gave a fuck about who they cheer fo'?
I only came here to show the difference between a real one and a weirdo
And when it's real you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head see if you can make them believe them lies
Time

[Round 3: Tech 9]
Can y'all hear me? Well aight then
You good? Well aight then
S.P.I.T.T.A.G.E
Y'all motherfuckers get it right Wayne A.V.E
Look at my eyes, you see nothin' but pain inside
I done lost love ones, close friends, they talkin' change
Well in my city ain't nothin' in mine
Over a quarter you can catch a quarter, I got a little change in mind
These young boys on a suicide mission cause they was trained to ride
Innocent bystanders gettin' shot cause these pussies aimin' high
When it's hot the murder rate pop
When it's cold the murder rate drop, it's crazy how the weather can be the reason whether you live or die
Gotti you can't talk this real shit to me, everything you claim you did I've been through it
My little sister was murdered on the corner of my mother's block, now every time she walk home from work she gotta live through it
If you don't get killed by your own brother then the pigs do it
Stop snitchin', these little niggas get a story and they stick to it
I got so many guns sometimes I don't know how to pick 'em
First it's the TEC, warning shots so I rip low
Second is the 4-5, the feelin' make me wanna grip mo'
The third is the AR the shit got me walkin' like my hip broke
I can't figure out what gun I wanna smoke you with but don't trip though
Cause you can get 'em all, you can get the 1, 2 and the 3 like Avocado intro

{Chokes}

You look like one of them old ass hip hop fans, that knows the words to every song
Y'all know that friend that know the first verse before it comes on?
Regulator!
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of skirts, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
Mount up
Nigga how you rap the first verse before the mount up
Some of the shit you do just don't mount up
Crib like a gun store, AK and AR's on the wall I got the mount up
Trap house movin' dope sales
Security on lock don't get your throat melt
Come to my crib with all that vendin'
And it's a machine on every floor like it's a hotel
Personals, why I gotta dig dirt
If I dig dirt it's followed by a casket, big hearse
What L.A. did to Notorious, I should strangle you with a big shirt
[?] and I got somethin' and common
She 4'5"" and I got the 4-5, we both tryin' to wig first

Somebody call Al Kapone cause Gotti catchin' the cig' (Sig') first
Champion, we treat battle rap like it's a sport too
Extension, drive-by on the court too
Cheap money, big talk and you can't afford to
Game Of Thrones, my gun don't got a body but my sword do
Blades shiftin', Valerian steel, they made different
You talk at her, I talk to her, the age different
Lanes switchin', usin' 2-20 on the dash we race different
I land on the roof top of the hotel, you pull up with a roof top to the hotel we stay different
Breast milk baby, Similac bay, we raised different
You shakin' with the gun, I'm steady with the gun we raise different
Nigga owe you money you give them deadlines, extension
A nigga owe me money it's a dead line, extension
Cold killer, oh you a drama starter
I catch you at the crib playin' bones witcha girl
Knife out, put stake in ya company then turn around and hit you with the silent partner
Quiet investor, detective found stake in your company but couldn't find out where money came from cause I hit you with the silent, partner",eastcoast

T.E.C.H.N.I.N.E
This motherfucker look like Wayne Brady
Nigga you's a bitch!
What you gon' say? ""Oh, Gotti went to jail for a month, how'd he get out so quick?""
Nigga, if that's ya angle, you better dump that shit
Paper work, public info, you can go to the court and run my shit
The only thing I'm tellin'...is ya mama how to suck my dick
This nigga pussy, the respect gon'
The chopper have ya neck gon'
I stopped watchin' Champion, cause a Rest In Peace shirt the only thing I'm tryin' to see Tech on
You dead wrong, claimin' that you one of the greats
I'll put a gun in ya face, extendo
Clear 30, this ain't up for debate
You know what I hate?
Old ass niggas like you livin' off ya past battles
When your resume full of trash battles
Every round is jokes and more jokes
Niggas be watchin', just waitin' to see a punch like Math battles
I'm goin' hard all year I can't take it easy on these haters
Head shot, when he wake up all he remember was, ""You have what it takes. You can make it. You in the world's most respec-""
The doctor's be soundin' like Beasley on the trailers
These niggas is fakers
I was known for Crippin' way befo' I was known for rappin'
So keep calm befo' it's ya dome I'm tappin'
Thin R Streetz, if I pull it out, little nigga fo' sho' I'm clappin'
BAOW, Top, left of you hangin' on stage...real niggas know what happened
You don't rap like that, nigga fo' sho' I'm clappin'
Fuck a Tech 9, in battle rap you gon' stay wack
In the streets we use Rugers and Glocks
The only nigga usin' a Tec-9? JayBlac
Nigga straight facts
I stay strapped, bullets flyin', nigga you the victim
You gon' have to get Tech support; the computer trippin'
You a stupid nigga
You said I reuse bars, you know how stupid you sound?
Matter of fact, this the same can' I killed Ave wit'
BAOW, now that's how you recycle a round
Bitch you's a clown and ya mom's a silly ho
I'll fuck her in front of the microwave on camera, and let JayBlac do a reaction video
I'm disrespectful, I hope your baby mama get breast cancer while your baby gettin' breastfed
Before yo' granny die, I wanna be the nigga to pull up and take a piss on her deathbed
This nigga Tech dead, nigga you in my buildin', you can really lose ya life in
I hope you strapped, just know I got mines in
I'll kill you and that faggot ass light skinned hype man
And aim that shit at Smack like, ""Nigga is you good? Well aight then.""
I'm on one, kill mode just gotta make sure there ain't no witness lookin'
Cause I ain't tryin' to get caught, end up in that central booking
So I'm sneakin' with the biscuit, like my granny told me I couldn't eat til she finished cookin'
This nigga wussin', I don't listen when Tech speak
You lookin' at a pure shooter, just peep the technique
I can go over the top like a dramatic bitch or pull it behind ya back on some scandalous shit
Goddamn I'm sick
I'll let the .40 blam this bitch
I ain't never pressed for these weak hoes
Nina wit' me, I was lettin' mil's (Mill's) off befo' they freed Meek though
The heat low, the gun look fake but it ain't
Silly nigga, code word: Nicki Minaj
(What that mean?!)
This bitch plastic but(t) it'll drop a Philly nigga
Really nigga, I'm a street nigga, you the rapper
I'll shake ya hand before the battle then shoot him after
Ruger clapper
Stand over the body and put three in his face
Y'all gon' see this bitch get dumped over Tech (texts) like, ""I think I just need some space.""
You can plead ya case but I'ma keep shootin' G
This muhfucka fully automatic so I can let this bitch off easy
Like, ""Baby it's not you it's me.""
Who is he? It don't matter they all look the same after the trigger squeeze
We got nine's, .44's, and .45's, I'm puttin' everything on Tech like my Twitter feed
And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
Go 'head see if you can make them niggas believe them lies
Nigga time

[Round 1: Tech 9]
Can you hear me? Well aight then
You good ? Well aight then
They don' brought a nigga all the way from the east coast to battle a nigga on the west coast
And he's dope
I'm thinkin' Snoop, Dre, Chronic album, nothin' but weed smoke
Game, Nipsey, Kendrick, Eazy-E
Low riders, D.O.C., loc
Instead they got me battlin' Ray Swag and we all know that he choke
Bitch cut all this tough talk, don't be the one mark
He said, ""I'm so used to the shot I just gotta hear it and I can tell what it is by the gun spark.""
Nigga you dumb smart
A west coast nigga with gun smarts
But ya son in school gettin' asked, ""What's 2 + 2?"" Fuck he in class puttin' up 1 fo'?
But then again that's 1 fo'
14 shots to the body that's one fo'
I took the .44 off Hova now that got me with one fo'
Look at punk ass Geechi and his family with all these fem' gestures
Should I chin check him or bench press him?
Silencer over the silencer so you ain't gon' be able to call a shot all you gon' feel is the wind pressure
You on Twitter sayin' 9's known for jammin' tryin' to put the shame on niggas
Old school so when you said, ""the 9's jam"" I was like, ""Yeah NBA Jam they bang on niggas.""
Told y'all in 2012, Bill Collector, they bang on niggas
Reverse that to collect a bill I bang on
I wanna see you die in the worst way
Funeral, hearse 'play
After I kill you I can't stop, I kill ya family dirty on Thursday
Slit ya mother throat, drown your grandmother on her church day
Walk in ya kid's school and let it sing, I'm tryin' to celebrate they birthday
Two pistols, to keep 'em quiet I got two tennis balls on the end like a cripple I'm usin' a walker
If I don't slow it down or translate it, two racks, you tennis ball I don't do drive bys I'm usually the walker
And take it a step further, I'm tryin' to keep it non violent
But if granny keep hollerin' she gon' force the blunt force trauma and
Weapon of choice I'm usin' her walker
I can never die if you kill me it's Night King now I'm fused with The Walkers
I can't stand ya creep ass
Botox, fake bitch I see past ya cheap ass
Cocaine cartel I seek cash
Punchin' others faster than a Mayweather speed bag
D.A. rush in? I'm hidin' in the bathroom wall like Miguel Rodriguez
You on Twitter committing foul actions
I'll let the cal' blast him
If he don't die durin' the ambulance ride, then somethin' gon' go wrong at the hospital like a malpractice
Who gon' ride?
Turn this into a huntin' game, I pick you to die
Road kill, you jumped in front of that car that's deer suicide
Light the crib up, everybody in that bitch get crucified
The Uzi connected to a string, the string hangin' around my neck
I'm a Champion, we got a suit and tie
Niggas is pussy, online eatin' gangsta cookies
But soon as you try to take them to school they play hookie
I play the N.E.R.D.s this shit can get for real (Pharrell) if you push me
It force me to bring the A.R. in the building like a white boy that's bein' bullied
You good with words Gotti, I let a cap spray
Plus I can handle a Verb better than Pat Stay
O.B.C. how about I say I catch you early like a matinee?
No, I don't even hop out the car
I shoot through the window, bangin' the hand off the steering wheel like I'm havin' bad day
Shut the fuck up! Pull that lil' deuce deuce, go 'head buck up
You aimin' it wrong
A false move and ya luck up
I'm sick of you pussy ass niggas actin' tough tough
I'm from Philly, ain't no Bloods and Crips but the wrong jersey will get you fucked up
What is it? Gangsta gally? You the Cali king? They got your pictures on fliers?

It be everyday I be gettin' frustrated wishin' I could just save 'em
Cause they write letters to niggas who won't even write back
The only letter they get is the one the judge gave 'em
And you think I gave a fuck about who they cheer fo'?

THE ORIGINS OF THE VAMPIRE

THROUGHOUT the whole vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. Around the vampire have clustered the most sombre superstitions, for he is a thing which belongs to no world at all; he is not a demon, for the devils have a purely spiritual nature, they are beings without any body, angels, as is said in S. Matthew xxv. 41, ""the devil and his angels.""[1] And although S. Gregory writes of the word Angel, ""nomen est officii, non naturae,""--the designation is that of an office not of a nature, it is clear that all angels were in the beginning created good in order to act as the divine messengers (ἄγγελοι), and that afterwards the fallen angels lapsed from their original state. The authoritative teaching of the Fourth Lateran Council under Innocent III in 1215, dogmatically lays down: ""Diabolus enim et alii daemones a Deo quidem natura creati sunt boni, sed ipsi per se facti sunt mali."" And it is also said, Job iv. 18: ""Ecce qui seruiunt ei, non sunt stabiles, et in Angelis suis reperit prauitatem."" (Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness.)

John Heinrich Zopfius in his Dissertatio de Uampiris Seruiensibus, Halle, 1733, says: ""Vampires issue forth from their graves in the night, attack people sleeping quietly in their beds, suck out all their blood from their bodies and destroy them. They beset men, women and children alike, sparing neither age nor sex. Those who are under the fatal malignity of their influence complain of suffocation and a total deficiency of spirits, after which they soon expire. Some who, when at the point of death, have been asked if they can tell what is causing their decease, reply that such and such persons, lately dead, have arisen from the tomb to torment and torture them."" Scoffern in his Stray Leaves of Science and Folk Lore writes: ""The best definition I can give of a vampire is a living, mischievous and murderous dead body. A living dead body! The words are idle, contradictory, incomprehensible, but so are Vampires."" Horst, Schriften und Hypothesen über die Vampyren, (Zauberbibliothek, III) defines a Vampire as ""a dead body which continues to live in the grave; which it leaves, however, by night, for the purpose of sucking the blood of the living, whereby it is nourished and preserved in good condition, instead of becoming decomposed like other dead bodies.""

A demon has no body, although for purposes of his own he may energize, assume, or seem to assume a body, but it is not his real and proper body.[2] So the vampire is not strictly a demon, although his foul lust and horrid propensities be truly demoniacal and of hell.

Neither may the vampire be called a ghost or phantom, strictly speaking, for an apparition is intangible, as the Latin poet tells us:

Par leuibus uentis uolucrique simillima somno.[3]

And upon that first Easter night when Jesus stood in the midst of His disciples and they were troubled and frightened, supposing they had seen a spirit, He said: ""Uidete manus meas, et pedes, quia ego ipse sum: palpate, et uidete: quia spiritus carnem, et ossa non habet, sicut ne uidetis habere."" (See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bone, as you see me to have.)[4]

There are, it is true, upon record some few instances when persons have been able to grasp, or have been grasped by and felt the touch of, a ghost, but these phenomena must be admitted as exceptions altogether, if indeed, they are not to be explained in some other way, as for example, owing to the information of a body by some spirit or familiar under very rare and abnormal conditions.

In the case of the very extraordinary and horrible hauntings of the old Darlington and Stockton Station, Mr. James Durham, the night-watchman, when one winter evening in the porter's cellar was surprised by the entry of a stranger followed by a large black retriever. This visitor without uttering a word dealt him a blow and he had the impression of a violent concussion. Naturally he struck back with his fist which seemed however to pass through the figure and his knuckles were grazed against the wall beyond. None the less the man uttered an unearthly squeak at which the dog gripped Mr. Durham in the calf of the leg causing considerable pain. In a moment the stranger had called off the retriever by a curious click of the tongue, and both man and animal hurried into the coal-house whence there was no outlet. A moment later upon examination neither was to be seen. It was afterwards discovered that many years before an official who was invariably accompanied by a large black dog had committed suicide upon the premises, if not in the very cellar, where at least his dead body had been laid. The full account with the formal attestation dated 9th December, 1890, may be read in W. T. Stead's Real Ghost Stories, reprint, Grant Richards, 1897, Chapter XI, pp. 210-214.

Major C. G. MacGregor of Donaghadee, County Down, Ireland, gives an account of a house in the north of Scotland which was haunted by an old lady, who resided there for very many years and died shortly after the beginning of the nineteenth century. Several persons who slept in the room were sensibly pushed and even smartly slapped upon the face. He himself on feeling a blow upon the left shoulder in the middle of the night turned quickly and reaching out grasped a human hand, warm, soft, and plump. Holding it tight he felt the wrist and arm which appeared clothed in a sleeve and lace cuff. At the elbow all trace ceased, and in his astonishment he released the hand. When a light was struck nobody could be seen in the room.

In a case which occurred at a cottage in Girvan, South Ayrshire, a young woman lost her brother, a fisher, owing to the swamping of his boat in a storm, When the body was recovered it was found that the right hand was missing. This occasioned the poor girl extraordinary sorrow, but some few nights later when she was undressing, preparatory to bed, she suddenly uttered a piercing shriek which immediately brought the other inmates of the house to her room. She declared that she had felt a violent blow dealt with an open hand upon her shoulder. The place was examined, and distinctly marked in livid bruises there was seen the impression of a man's right hand.

Andrew Lang in his Dreams and Ghosts (new edition, 1897), relates the story of ""The Ghost that Bit,"" which might seem to have been a vampire, but which actually cannot be so classed since vampires have a body and their craving for blood is to obtain sustenance for their body. The narrative is originally to be found in Notes and Queries, 3rd September 1864, and the correspondent asserts that he took it ""almost verbatim from the lips of the lady"" concerned, a person of tried veracity. Emma S------ was asleep one morning in her room at a large house near Cannock Chase. It was a fine August day in 1840, but although she had bidden her maid call her at an early hour she was surprised to hear a sharp knocking upon her door about 3.30. In spite of her answer the taps continued, and suddenly the curtains of her bed were slightly drawn, when to her amaze she saw the face of an aunt by marriage looking through upon her. Half unconsciously she threw out her hand, and immediately one of her thumbs was sensibly premed by the teeth of the apparition. Forthwith she arose, dressed, and went downstairs, where not a creature was stirring. Her father upon coming down rallied her a little upon being about at cockcrow and inquired the cause. When she informed him he determined that later in the day he would pay a visit to his sister-in-law who dwelt at no great distance. This he did, only to discover that she had unexpectedly died at about 3.30 that morning. She had not been in any way ailing, and the shock was fearfully sudden. On one of the thumbs of the corpse was found a mark as if it had been bitten in the last agony.

The disturbances at the Lamb hostelry, Lawford's Gate, Bristol, which aroused something more than local interest in the years 1761-62, were not improbably due to witchcraft and caused by the persecutions of a woman who trafficked in occultism of the lowest order, although on the other hand they may have been poltergeist manifestations. The two little girls, Molly and Debby Giles, who were the subjects of these phenomena, were often severely bitten and pinched. The impressions of eighteen or twenty teeth were seen upon their arms, the marks being clammy with saliva and warm spittle, ""and the children were roaring out for the pain of the pinches and bites."" On one occasion whilst an observer was talking to Dobby Giles she cried out that she was bitten in the neck when there suddenly appeared ""the mark of teeth, about eighteen, and wet with spittle."" That the child should have nipped herself was wholly impossible, and nobody was near her save Mr. Henry Durbin who recorded these events, and whose account was first printed in 1800, the year after his death, since he did not wish his notes to be given to the public during his lifetime. On 2nd January, 1762, Mr. Durbin notes: ""Dobby cried the hand was about her sister's throat, and I saw the flesh at the side of her throat pushed in, whitish as if done with fingers, though I saw none. Her face grew red and blackish presently, as if she was strangled, but without any convulsion or contraction of the muscles."" Thursday, 7th January, 1762, we have: ""Dobby was bitten most and with deeper impressions than Molly. The impression of the teeth on their arms formed an oval, which measured two inches in length."" All this certainly looks as if sorcery were at work. It may be remembered that in Salem during the epidemic of witchcraft the afflicted persons were tormented ""by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, etc."" When Goodwife Corey was on trial, ""it was observed several times, that if she did but bite her under lip in time of examination, the Persons afflicted were bitten on their arms and Wrists, and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Minister, and others.""

In The Proceedings of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, Vol. I., 1927, will be found an account of the phenomena connected with Eleonore Zügun, a young Rumanian peasant girl, who in the autumn of 1926, when only thirteen years old was brought to London by the Countess Wassilko-Serecki, in order that the manifestations might be investigated at ""The National Laboratory of Psychical Research,"" Queensberry Place, South Kensington. The child was said to be persecuted by some invisible force or agent, which she knew as Dracu, Anglice the Devil. There were many extraordinary happenings and she was continually being scratched and bitten by this unseen intelligence. It must suffice to give but two or three instances of the very many ""biting phenomena."" On the afternoon of Monday, 4th October, 1926, Captain Neil Gow an investigator in his report, notes: ""3.20. Eleonore cried out. Showed marks on back of left hand like teeth-marks which afterwards developed into deep weals. . . . 4.12. Eleonore was just raising a cup of tea to her lips, but suddenly gave a cry and put the cup down hastily: there was a mark on her right hand similar to that caused by a bite. Both rows of teeth were indicated."" Of the same incident, Mr. Clapham Palmer, an investigator who was also present writes: ""Eleonore was in the act of raising the cup to her lips when she suddenly gave a little cry of pain, put down her cup and rolled up her sleeve. On her forearm I then saw what appeared to be the marks of teeth indented deeply in the flesh, as if she or someone had fiercely bitten her arm. The marks turned from red to white and finally took the form of white raised weals. They gradually faded but were still noticeable after an hour or so."" Such bitings not infrequently occurred, and photographs have been taken of the marks.

It were an interesting question to discuss the cause of these indentations and no doubt it is sufficiently remarkable, but however that may be such inquiry were impertinent here, for it is clearly not vampirism, nor indeed cognate thereto. The object of the Vampire is to suck blood, and in these cases if blood was ever drawn it was more in the nature of a scratch or slight dental puncture, there was no effusion. Again the agent who inflicted these bites was not sufficiently material to be visible, at any rate he was able to remain unseen. The true vampire is corporeal.

The vampire has a body, and it is his own body. He is neither dead nor alive; but living in death. He is an abnormality; the androgyne in the phantom world; a pariah among the fiends.

Even the Pagan poet taught his hearers and his readers that death was a sweet guerdon of repose, a blessed oblivion after the toil and struggle of life. There are few things more beautiful and there are few things more sad than the songs of our modern Pagans who console their aching hearts with the wistful vision of eternal sleep. Although perhaps they themselves know it not, their delicate but despairing melancholy is an heritage from the weary yet tuneful singers of the last days of Hellas, souls for whom there was no dawn of hope in the sky. But we have a certain knowledge and a fairer surety for ""now Christ is risen from the dead, the first-fruits of them that sleep."" Yet Gray, half Greek, seems to promise to his rustics and his hinds as their richest reward after life of swink and toil dear forgetfulness and eternal sleep. Swinburne was glad:

That no life lives for ever
That dead men rise up never;
That even the weariest river
Winds somewhere safe to sea.
.    .    .    .    .
Only the eternal sleep
In an eternal night.

Emily Brontë lusted for mere oblivion:

Oh, for the time when I shall sleep
Without identity.
And never care how rain may steep,
Or snow may cover me!

Flecker in utter despair wails out:

I know dead men are deaf, and cannot hear
The singing of a thousand nightingales . . .
I know dead men are blind and cannot see
The friend that shuts in horror their big eyes,
And they are witless--

Even more beautifully than the poets have sung, a weaver of exquisite prose has written: ""Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time."" Poor sorry souls! How arid, how empty are such aspirations when we think of the ardent glowing phrase of the Little Flower: ""Je veux passer mon ciel à faire du bien sur la terre!"" And ""Even in the bosom of the Beatific Vision the Angels watch over us. No, I shall never be able to take any rest until the end of the world. But when the Angel shall have said 'Time is no more,' then I shall rest, then I shall be able to rejoice, since the number of the elect will be complete.""

So we see that even for those who take the most pagan, the most despairing, the most erroneous views, the ideal is oblivion and rest. How fearful a destiny then is that of the vampire, who has no rest in the grave, but whose doom it is to come forth and prey upon the living. In the first place it may briefly be inquired how the belief in vampirism originated, and here it is not impertinent to remark that the careful investigations in connexion with psychic phenomena which have been so fruitful of recent years, and even modern scientific discovery, have proved the essential truth of many an ancient record and old superstition, which were until yesterday dismissed by the level-headed as the wildest sensationalism of melodramatic romance. The origins of a belief in vampirism, although, of course, very shadowy, unformed and unrelated, may probably be said to go back to the earliest times when primitive man observed the mysterious relations between soul and body. The division of an individual into these two parts must have been suggested to man by his observation, however crude and rough, of the phenomenon of unconsciousness, as exhibited in sleep and more particularly in death. He cannot but have speculated concerning that something, the loss of which withdraws man for ever from the living and waking world. He was bound to ask himself if there was any continuance in any circumstances at present veiled from, and unknown to, him of that life and that personality which had obviously passed elsewhere. The question was an eternal one, and it was, moreover, a personal one which concerned him most intimately, since it related to an experience he could not expect to escape. It was clear to him before long that the process called death was merely a passage to another world, and naturally enough he pictured that world as being very like the one he knew, only man would there enjoy extended powers over the forces with which he waged such ceaseless war for the mastery during his period on earth. It might be that the world was not so very far away, and it was not to be supposed that persons who had passed over would lose their interest in and affection for those who for a little while had been left behind. Relations must not be forgotten just because they did not happen to be visibly present, any more than to-day we forget one of the family who has gone on a voyage for a week or a month or a year. Naturally those whose age and position during their lifetime had entitled them to deference and respect must be treated with the same consideration, nay, with even more ample honours since their authority had become mysteriously greater and they would be more active to punish any disrespect or neglect. Hence as a family venerated the father of the house both in life and after death, which was the germ of ancestral worship, so the tribe would venerate the great men, the chieftains and the heroes, whose exploits had won so much not only for their own particular houses, but for the whole clan. The Shilluk, a tribe who dwell upon the western bank of the White Nile, and who are governed by a single king, still maintain the worship of Nyakang, the hero who founded the dynasty and settled this people in their present territory. Nyakang is conceived as having been a man, although he did not actually die but vanished from sight. Yet he is not altogether divine, for the great god of the Shilluk, the creator of mankind and the world, Juok, is without form, invisible and omnipresent. He is far greater than and far above Nyakang, and he reigns in those highest heavens where neither the prayers of man can reach his ears, nor can he smell the sweet savour of sacrifice.

Not only Nyakang, but each of the Shilluk kings after death is worshipped, and the grave of the monarch becomes a sanctuary, so that throughout the villages there are many shrines tended by certain old men and old women, where a ritual which is practically identical in each separate place is elaborately conducted. Indeed, the principal element in the religion of the Shilluk may be said to be the veneration of their dead kings.[5]

Other African tribes also worship their dead kings. The Baganda, whose country Uganda lies at the actual source of the Nile, think of their dead kings as being equal to the gods, and the temples of the deceased monarchs are built and maintained with the utmost care. Formerly when a king died hundreds of men were killed so that their spirits might attend upon the spirit of their master, and what is very significant as showing that these people believe the king and his ghostly followers could return in forms sufficiently corporeal to perform the very material function of eating is that on certain solemn days at earliest dawn the sacred tomtom is beaten at the temple gates and crowds of worshippers bring baskets of food for the dead king and his followers lest being hungry he should become angered and punish the whole tribe.[6]

In Kiziba, which lies on the western side of the Lake Victoria Nyanza, the religion of the natives consists of the worship of their dead kings, although there is a supreme god Rugada, who created the world, man and beasts, but even their hierarchs know little about him and he receives no sacrifice, the business of the priests being to act as intermediaries between the people and the dead monarchs.[7]

So the Bantu tribes of Northern Rhodesia acknowledge a supreme deity, Leza, whose power is manifested in the storm, in the torrential rain clouds, in the roar of thunder and the flash of lightning, but to whom there is no direct access by prayer or by sacrifice. The gods, then, whom these tribes worship are sharply divided into two classes, the spirits of departed chiefs, who are publicly venerated by the whole tribe, and the spirits of relations who are privately honoured by a family, whose head performs the sacerdotal functions upon these occasions. ""Among the Awemba there is no special shrine for these purely family spirits, who are worshipped inside the hut, and to whom family sacrifices of a sheep, a goat, or a fowl is made, the spirit receiving the blood spilt upon the ground, while all the members of the family partake of the flesh together. For a religious Wemba man the cult of the spirit of his nearest relations (of his grandparents, or of his deceased father, mother, elder brother or maternal uncle) is considered quite sufficient. Out of these spirit relatives a man will worship one whom he considers as a special familiar, for various reasons. For instance, the diviner may have told him that his last illness was caused because he had not respected the spirit of his uncle; accordingly he will be careful in the future to adopt his uncle as his tutelary spirit. As a mark of such respect he may devote a cow or a goat to one of the spirits of his ancestors.""[8] This custom is very significant, and two points should be especially noted. The first is that the deceased, or the spirit of the deceased, is not merely propitiated by, but partakes of, blood, which is spilt for his benefit. Secondly, the deceased, if not duly honoured, can cause illness, and therefore is capable of exercising a certain vengeful or malevolent power. The essential conception that underlies these customs is not so very far removed from the tradition of a vampire who craves to suck blood and causes sickness through his malignancy.

Very similar ideas prevail among the Herero, a Bantu tribe of German South-West Africa, who believe that Ndjambi Karunga, the great good god who dwells in heaven above is far too remote to be accessible, wherefore he neither receives nor requires worship and offerings. ""It is their ancestors (Ovakuru) whom they must fear; it is they who are angry and can bring danger and misfortune on a man . . . it is in order to win and keep their favour, to avert their displeasure and wrath, in short to propitiate them, that the Herero bring their many offerings; they do so not out of gratitude, but out of fear, not out of love, but out of terror.""[9] The Rev. G. Viehe, a missionary among the tribe writes: ""The religious customs and ceremonies of the Ovaherero are all rooted in the presumption that the deceased continue to live, and that they have a great influence on earth, and exercise power over the life and death of man.""[10]

The religion of the Ovambo, another Bantu tribe of German South-West Africa, runs on practically the same lines. The supreme being, Kalunga, the creator, desires neither adoration nor fear. The whole religion is the worship, or rather the propitiation, of the spirits of the dead. Every man at death leaves behind him a phantom form which continues a certain kind of life (not very clearly defined) upon earth, and this spirit has power over the living. Especially may it cause various kinds of sickness. The spirits of private persons can only exert their influence over the members of their own families; the souls of chiefs and great warriors have a much wider scope, they can influence the whole clan for weal or woe; they can even to some extent control the powers of nature and ensure a bountiful corn-crop by their careful provision of rain, since under their kindly direction there shall be neither too little nor too great an abundance. Moreover, they can ward off disease, but if on the other hand they be offended they can visit the tribe with pestilence and famine. It may be particularly noted that among the Ovambo the phantoms of dead magicians are dreaded and feared in no ordinary manner. The only way to prevent the increase of these dangerous spirit folk is by depriving the body of its limbs, a precaution which must be taken immediately after death. So it is customary to sever the arms and legs from the trunk and to cut the tongue out of the mouth, in order that the spirit may have no power either of movement or of speech, since the mutilation of the corpse has rendered a ghost, who would assuredly be both powerful and truculent, inoperative and incapable.[11] It will later be seen that the mutilation, the cutting off of the head, and especially the driving of a stake through the body with other dismemberments, were resorted to as the most effective means, short of complete cremation, of dealing with a vampire, whilst according to Theosophists only those become vampires who have during their lifetime been adepts in black magic, and Miss Jessie Adelaide Middleton says that the people who become vampires are witches, wizards and suicides.[12]

Canon Callaway has recorded some very interesting details of Amatongo or Ancestor Worship among the Zulus.[13] A native account runs as follows: ""The black people do not worship all Amatongo indifferently, that is, all the dead of their tribes. Speaking generally, the head of each house is worshipped by the children of that house; for they do not know the ancients who are dead, nor their laud-giving names, nor their names. But their father whom they knew is the head by whom they begin and end in their prayer, for they know him best, and his love for his children; they remember his kindness to them whilst he was living, they compare his treatment of them whilst he was living, support themselves by it and say, 'He will still treat us in the same way now he is dead. We do not know why he should regard others besides us; he will regard us only.' So it is then although they worship the many Amatongo of their tribe, making a great fence around them for their protection; yet their father is far before all others when they worship the Amatongo. Their father is a great treasure to them even when he is dead."" It would appear that among the Zulus the spirits of those who are recently deceased, especially the fathers and mothers of families, are most generally venerated and revered. As is natural, the spirits of the remoter dead are forgotten, for time passes and their memory perishes when those who knew them and sang their praises follow them into the world beyond. As we have remarked, in nearly every case we find recognized the existence of a supreme being, who is certainly a high spiritual power that had never been a man, and the homage paid to whom (in those very rare instances[14] where such worship is conceived of as desirable or even possible) differs entirely from the cult of the dead, be they family ancestors or some line of ancient kings. There are, of course, many other gods in the African pantheon, and although the natives will not allow that these were ever men, and indeed sharply differentiate in ritual practice their worship from the cult of the spirits and phantoms, yet in nearly all cases it is to be suspected, and in many cases it is certain, that these gods were heroes of old whose legend instead of becoming faint with years and dying away grew more and more splendid until the monarch or the warrior passed into pure deity. A similar process holds forth in heathen religions the wide world over. and with regard to the Baganda polytheism the Rev. J. Roscoe remarks ""The principal gods appear to have been at one time human beings, noted for their skill and bravery, who were afterwards deified by the people and invested with supernatural powers.""[13]

It is said that the Caffres believe that men of evil life after death may return during the night in corporeal form and attack the living, often wounding and killing them. It seems that these revenants are much attracted by blood which enables them more easily to effect their purpose, and even a few red drops will help to vitalize their bodies. So a Caffre has the greatest horror of blood, and will never allow even a spot fallen from a bleeding nose or a cut to lie uncovered, but should it stain the ground it must be instantly hidden with earth, and if it splotch upon their bodies they must purify themselves from the pollution with elaborate lustral ceremonies.[16] Throughout the whole of West Africa indeed the natives are careful to stamp out any blood of theirs which happens to have fallen to the ground, and if a cloth or a piece of wood should be marked thereby these articles are most carefully burned.[17] They openly admit that the reason for this is lest a drop of blood might come into the hands of a magician who would make evil use of it, or else it might be caught up by a bad spirit and would then enable him to form a tangible body. The same fear of sorcery prevails in New Guinea, where the natives if they have been wounded will most carefully collect the bandages and destroy them by burning or casting them far into the sea, a circumstance which has not infrequently been recorded by missionaries and travellers.[18]

There are, indeed, few if any peoples who have not realized the mysterious significance attached to blood, and examples of this belief are to be found in the history of every clime. It is expressed by the Chinese writers on medicine[19]; it was held by the Arabs[20], and it is prominent among the traditions of the Romans.[21] Even with regard to animals the soul or life of the animal was in the blood, or rather actually was the blood. So we have the divine command, Leviticus xvii. 10-14: ""Homo quilibet de domo Israel, et de aduenis qui peregrinantur inter eos, si comederit sanguinem, obfirmabo faciem meam contra animam illius, et dispertam eam de populo suo. Quia anima carnis in sanguine est: et ego dedi illum uobis, ut super altare in eo expietis pro animabus uestris, et sanguis pro animae piaculo sit. Idcirco dixi filiis Israel: Omnis anima ex uobis non comedet sanguinem, nec ex aduenis, qui peregrinantur apud uos. Homo quicumque ex filiis Israel, et de aduenis, qui peregrinantur apud uos, si uenatione atque aucupio ceperit feram uel auem, quibus esci licitum est, fundat sanguinem eius, et operiat illum terra. Anima enim omnis carnis in sanguine est: unde dixi filiis Israel: Sanguinem uniuersae carnis non comedetis, quia anima carnis in sanguine est: et quicumque comederit illum, interibit."" (If any man whosoever of the house of Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among them, eat blood I will set my face against his soul, and will cut him off from among his people: Because the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an expiation for the soul. Therefore I have said to the children of Israel: No soul of you, nor of the strangers that sojourn among you, shall eat blood. Any man whatsoever of the children of Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among you, if by hunting or by fowling, he take a wild beast or a bird, which is lawful to eat, let him pour out its blood, and cover it with earth. For the life of all flesh is in the blood: therefore I said to the children of Israel: You shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all, because the life of the flesh is in the blood, and whosoever eateth it, shall be cut off.)[22] The Hebrew word which is translated ""life""[23] in this passage and particularly in the phrase ""Because the life of the flesh is in the blood,"" also signifies ""Soul,"" and the Revised Version has a marginal note: ""Heb. soul."" Since then the very essence of life, and even more, the spirit or the soul in some mysterious way lies in the blood we have a complete explanation why the vampire should seek to vitalize and rejuvenate his own dead body by draining the blood from the veins of his victims.

It will be remembered that in a famous necromantic passage in the Odyssey[24], when Ulysses calls up the ghosts from the underworld, in order",eastcoast

I came in L.A., motorcycle like, ""Aye cuz where the fuck is the plug?""
Parked on Crenshaw, then Gotti stole my bike, see he playin' too much
I said you rap with your head down, I wasn't tryin' to play you for chump
Well since Baby Boy wanna steal bikes, now he gotta rap with his head up while y'all wait for the punch
You shavin' dirt
I want my money back or your dame get murked
Or I can shoot her in the neck or the blade will work
If you played Captain Save A Hoe the stainless burst
Stab an ice pick in ya eye then rerun it across your face like it's my favorite shirt
That line was naaah, used that sloppy
Could I have used it a better way? Probably
Let me rewind that line back, copy
Gem star to your neck then rerun it across your face it look like I'm playin' air hockey
Streets Of Rage, I can hit him with the ax or he can meet the blade
Hunter with this thunder right now it's time to stop the microwave
Of course I love wrestling bars, I'll get you Rock'ed slam
Shawn Michaels with the kick, I got a hot hand
These Dudley Brothers, one lift you in the air and the other put you through a table
I'm a beast, married to that white girl, call her Sable
Bitch where, Roman Reigns you get your shit spared
North Carolina/Detroit, T-Top to Tee Grizzley, I brought a big bear
A new day for this Uso I'll let a clip air
Two AR's got me walkin' like Ric Flair
I came in this game filled with stars, I'm talkin' VCR's
The Chinese spot, everything we spit was raw
I've been in tough battles, my resume is built with scars
Gotti you ain't nothin' but a cash register so I treat you like a cashier and tuck one under like the bill too large
I'm back on Smack it's time for my Ascension
Ready for the bullshit so miss me with the detention
Layin' on a roof is the only time I'm crawlin' for position
You sell hair so you should be used to these extensions
Gotti I thought you was a real one
You said you had six months to a year in jail and you came home in two weeks
Sheesh
I don't know what type of deal you cut, man that shit was sweet
They confronted you with jail time unless you turned informant, made you squeak
Southside Compton Crip huh?
No wonder they got you out here tellin' on the nephews like [?]
I'll put 18 through your wheel, the dawgs on it
You hop out and try to run, I'm all on it
Catch him at the end of the trailer and then I pull it
{Beasley voice} Although we do this for sport, it is not a game
He got hit with a Beasley bullet
Call it quits
If I make change it's for the Parliament
I got .40 cents in my hand and I'm spendin' all of it
I want your baby mother, I heard she was a baller bitch
So I can stuff her in a black trash bag, that's how you ball a bitch
You'se a Beverly Hills rapper
Ain't no murders down there
You keep your doors locked for what? Ain't no burglars down there
Come to Philly, you fuck around and get murdered down there
Talkin' beef, turn his body to burger down there
Talk is cheap, we take it a step further down there
Not Geechi man but Gucci Man, the clip go blllet blllet burn down there
You bird nigga
Round 2

[Round 3: Geechi Gotti]
Aye this nigga got his mans right here tellin' you the words the whole time and shit
{laughs}
And then you rap for like ten minutes wastin' niggas time and shit
Tryin' to play me for a snitch, man that shit wack
In Cali them type of accusations will get you bitch slapped
Real rap, but I heard Tech a legend
I say, ""A legend for what? Cause he beat Miles?""
Nigga what that mean to a nigga that beat trials?
Free my nigga Doggy and Baby Wood, my bros on that fo' yard
Say they livin' through me, so I ain't got no choice but to go hard
See I coulda been killed, if it wasn't for rappin'
Still duckin' them shots from guns that's clappin'
They say my life like a movie
I say this shit couldn't be comedy cause I wasn't laughin'
And when them niggas came through shootin' clips and my patnas died on the scene, that wasn't actin'
Y'all remember Boyz N The Hood?
Ice Cube played Doughboy, that movie made him a star
But we in land of the gangbang, walk ups and drive bys
That wasn't the first time I seen a nigga let the tre (Trey) out the car
True story, I hate it when they say cause we grew up in the hood we hopeless
Nigga that's a damn lie cause I remember goin' to school and my teachers used to be like, You can be whatever you want, you don't gotta be this thug guy.""
I said, ""I know. I believe anything is possible. Shit yesterday I seen some slugs fly.""
Now listen, When Doves Cry, see growin' up, that song ain't make a lot of sense
Til my patna got cracked for a murder cause he ain't had gloves on That's when I realized you can actually learn a lot from prints (Prince)
Now I've been pissed, off for a minute
Cause y'all remember I asked a mama what hurt more; givin' birth or buryin' him?
She told me it was givin' birth, now that answer threw me to the left
She said cause she never planned on bein' pregnant but the way that nigga was livin' she was already plannin' for his death
Now this lifestyle will have a nigga stressed
Like the condom broke in a hoodrat
My biggest fear, is gettin' smoked by a nigga who was just askin' where the woods at
True story, that's why I'm never slippin', it's forever grippin'
Two straps, one nine, one revolver, the code word: Red Lobster
(What the fuck that mean?)
You will get this before the meal, it's a cheddar biscuit
The Metal Twisted, but it's not a game
I hold it like this cause I don't need the aim
BAOW, put this clown head on fire he Needles Kane
The heat'll bang, they told me, if they ain't ridin' for you, then what the fuck you doin' wit' 'em?
I sent a prayer up to Spittage, he told me to tell you stop sayin' his name before the battles if you gon' be losin' in 'em
Stupid nigga
My cousin Wicked got hit when that Tec jammed; true story
I'm just glad he live to tell about it
My patna got shot in his couch, left stankin' in the house
I seen his grandma she said she still can't get the smell up out it
You gotta have the stomach for this
I digress cause seein' my niggas just die, that's hard to digest
But I guess, we done been to enough jails
Even blindfolded we can sketch out the cell pattern
This the gangland where niggas die, rags cover the coughin' (coffin) like we well mannered
My niggas hit me everyday like, ""Gotti what's up? I'm glad you got out.""
Cause I'm one of the few niggas that understand a green dot is more important than a shoot out
My niggas be in there pissed off, thinkin' that niggas don't give a fuck about him like they must hate 'em
It be everyday I be gettin' frustrated wishin' I could just save 'em
Cause they write letters to niggas who won't even write back
The only letter they get is the one the judge gave 'em
And you think I gave a fuck about who they cheer fo'?
I only came here to show the difference between a real one and a weirdo
And when it's real you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head see if you can make them believe them lies
Time

[Round 3: Tech 9]
Can y'all hear me? Well aight then
You good? Well aight then
S.P.I.T.T.A.G.E
Y'all motherfuckers get it right Wayne A.V.E
Look at my eyes, you see nothin' but pain inside
I done lost love ones, close friends, they talkin' change
Well in my city ain't nothin' in mine
Over a quarter you can catch a quarter, I got a little change in mind
These young boys on a suicide mission cause they was trained to ride
Innocent bystanders gettin' shot cause these pussies aimin' high
When it's hot the murder rate pop
When it's cold the murder rate drop, it's crazy how the weather can be the reason whether you live or die
Gotti you can't talk this real shit to me, everything you claim you did I've been through it
My little sister was murdered on the corner of my mother's block, now every time she walk home from work she gotta live through it
If you don't get killed by your own brother then the pigs do it
Stop snitchin', these little niggas get a story and they stick to it
I got so many guns sometimes I don't know how to pick 'em
First it's the TEC, warning shots so I rip low
Second is the 4-5, the feelin' make me wanna grip mo'
The third is the AR the shit got me walkin' like my hip broke
I can't figure out what gun I wanna smoke you with but don't trip though
Cause you can get 'em all, you can get the 1, 2 and the 3 like Avocado intro

{Chokes}

You look like one of them old ass hip hop fans, that knows the words to every song
Y'all know that friend that know the first verse before it comes on?
Regulator!
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of skirts, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
Mount up
Nigga how you rap the first verse before the mount up
Some of the shit you do just don't mount up
Crib like a gun store, AK and AR's on the wall I got the mount up
Trap house movin' dope sales
Security on lock don't get your throat melt
Come to my crib with all that vendin'
And it's a machine on every floor like it's a hotel
Personals, why I gotta dig dirt
If I dig dirt it's followed by a casket, big hearse
What L.A. did to Notorious, I should strangle you with a big shirt

She 4'5"" and I got the 4-5, we both tryin' to wig first

Somebody call Al Kapone cause Gotti catchin' the cig' (Sig') first
Champion, we treat battle rap like it's a sport too
Extension, drive-by on the court too
Cheap money, big talk and you can't afford to
Game Of Thrones, my gun don't got a body but my sword do
Blades shiftin', Valerian steel, they made different
You talk at her, I talk to her, the age different
Lanes switchin', usin' 2-20 on the dash we race different
I land on the roof top of the hotel, you pull up with a roof top to the hotel we stay different
Breast milk baby, Similac bay, we raised different
You shakin' with the gun, I'm steady with the gun we raise different
Nigga owe you money you give them deadlines, extension
A nigga owe me money it's a dead line, extension
Cold killer, oh you a drama starter

While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke—gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
""Hail Mary, full of grace—"" smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper (Uh-huh)

Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies; no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit Mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked my dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that (ehh, uh-uh)
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with a broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound

For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
Niggas stay yappin when there's always somethin funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin from me

Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix

And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit

Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam

Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

Do jokes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep...
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel

Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world

[Verse 1]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up north, bound first stop for the town
Of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

Well, in God we trust, guns I bust

Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock

I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs

Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East Coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen, you never see bank like Frank White

I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trusting niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks, keep your wrist covered, I'm piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother

I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue

And three charges, I got to ""See-three-P.O.'s""

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
""Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?""
Yo, who dis? ""Taisha"" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook 1: Notorious BIG]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

""Why you wanna get with me?""

She said ""If I get with you

Sling skins for a living,my name ain't November

Mack it up, flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down

You hitting this nigga, how that sound?""
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on

How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G]
I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said ""I don't care, so don't be acting silly""
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, ""I wanna get freaky with you""
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you
You make the head feel special
Now I know it's official
That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house

Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose

My son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying

We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that

He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating

And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music

I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous

The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave",eastcoast
