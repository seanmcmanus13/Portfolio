1996!
Back up in this nigga
The right way, though, you know?
(Double-tre son, you know ain't nothin' coincidental or accidental, dunn)
No doubt!
(You know how it's goin' down, man)
It was all written
(No question, I'm sayin' man, I mean, how we playin' man
You know what I'm sayin', they dealt us in, son
They playin' with a 54 deck, you see with the jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying?)
Son, I'm playin' with the 52
(You wanna stress on how I used to play, that's how I playin')
But, yo, they takin' us into this next millennium, right now
(I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law
Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin'
That's why these cats are slippin' through, you know what I'm sayin? They got the rules missin' though)
True
(Yo, word up, though, you know what I mean?)
Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son
(Yeah, you see that they look Monopoly money, right?)
Word, with the big ass face on it
(Yo, what I'm sayin', we see through all that, though
You know what I'm sayin?)

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
Ninety-six ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze, make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate with my dunns
Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
Twenty G bets, I'm winnin' 'em; threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline, party with villains
A case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi TEC—who want it?
Diamonds, I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace 'em
Fried broiled with basil, taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Refrain]
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin', I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him; what was he thinkin'
On my corner when it's pay-me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop, so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep, watchin', all he seen speed by
Was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

[Hook]
Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back

[Outro: Nas + (AZ)]
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', yaknowmsayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
Bring the shit, man! Live, man!

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something",eastcoast

[Intro]
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me and bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered they pull me out
I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves
Under beds so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty, it's clear
He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said it was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!",eastcoast

[Verse 1: Nas]
They never realized how real Nas is so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit, my thesis
On how we creep quick, fucking your wife that ain't so secret
It's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you
The Mag inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own in this ghetto inhabitant

[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown]
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

[Verse 2: Nas]
Now how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?)
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to ""Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seatbelt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightment
My Movado says seven, the God hour that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato

[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

[Verse 3: Nas]
Some niggas watch you (uhh)
See you when you think you on the low
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself 'nobody's taking mine'
At the same time your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, where's the hundred grand, strippin' her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin' ganja, get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder: shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (what, hah)
Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh)
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezing executioner
Winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxing, my bitches, they be laughing
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini
Flipping mad pies, low price
I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
MC's are crawling out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 2]
Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singing Reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia
For wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither
Like Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 3]
Yo, the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's
Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

[Chorus]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that

The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the firm
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Verse 3: Nas]
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Cris' push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro diamond roll, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes
These three words are sung

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Check this out, it's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Ayo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honies
This Cristal and party to the year 2G

Nas is coming

Nasty Nas is coming

[Intro: AZ]
This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moët Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it times three, we got 48
Which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Nine-six, Escobar 600

[Verse 1: Nas (Havoc)]
Check the shit
My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY'RE BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Beamers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
""Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge, I'm bout to go loca""
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over, my nigga Hav gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back, Escobar status
Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it, shit we was born with

[Chorus: Havoc]
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness

Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

Hold it right there, pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin', after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus
And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him ""Don't grab, boo""
They started chattin', was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed them pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin'
There the girls go, hurry up we out
In the 940, me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

Not that White Star!

[JoJo Hailey]
Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby baby listen

[Verse 1: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - following week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up ma, fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

[Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 2: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Like Isis, you got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, startin wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you, you never listen
To this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree

[Chorus: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I

(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 3: Nas (JoJo Hailey)]
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop them off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong

It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck
Niggas is buck,"" mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo he should have ducked""
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for rilla, I'm all high
It's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life clock
The beast'll time ya, cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Bursting, blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me

[Chorus]
To the suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

[Verse 2]
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless, slaughter
Nautica Down, frames look petite
Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Roll the two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The wedding of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you with? Luchi or drama
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya

[Chorus]
Suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)

Yeah, yeah
It justifies Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting gem stars, words in my mic type receiver

[Verse 1]
Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open let your Gi-Glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
Ayo the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now

Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two to four
Niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord
Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Somethin' in the air yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin' - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-Cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'

Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

Yo, NYC, U-N-I-verse, seriously
Havoc and P, Queens niggas so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise
Mega got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette tape of
The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tied they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin him too
JFK on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate

[Verse 2: Havoc]
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me
We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser
Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped
(Floatin' in the river with your body wrapped in plastic)
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in
Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin'
We think smarter, reach harder
Got the .44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

[Verse 3: Nas]
Niggas thinkin' shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair, chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder cliques meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on the phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock or swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Airy lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than El DeBarge's
Catchin' charges, of marksmen, livin' heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin', puttin' niggas in mausoleums
From Queens cross the Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin', composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?)
It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good she'll bring you customers and measuring pots, but yo
You gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in the New York State of Mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I've taken rappers to a new plateau
Through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah

You know what I'm sayin'?

The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go

Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep

Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre

For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Ayo it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me, ""Nas ain't all that.""
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime

[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out

Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

[Verse 1]
I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines
The high pipes, murderous night times
And knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler
I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace God!) Peace God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all…

[Chorus]
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I'll reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

[Chorus]
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Yo, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it out, when I'm chilling, I grab the buddha
Get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top

[Chorus 2: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
Hey yo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit was phat
But kick that for them gangstas, man fuck all that!
Right, right

[Verse 2: Nas]
What up, niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'ma lamp, ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling ""Free the mind""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

One time for your mind, one time

One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners
(Ay, yo, yo, who that?), they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell

Blood of a slave, heart of a King - turn my voice up

Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards stupid here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced directed by
The Kid slash Escobar; narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning - nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils

Fuck Jay Z!

(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly

Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

[Interlude 2]
I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?

You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 3]
It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)",eastcoast

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Verse 1]
Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Verse 2]
My nigga smoke with one lung
If he cough he might die, passin' me trees
The liquor bottle's almost empty
We about to collide, with the enemy
Only way you die if it's meant to be
You fuckin' with a general
No discussion is the principle we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink; my kind of war
Death, angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

[Verse 3]
Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this niggas right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start
""I shall - stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never, cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear""
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance, to the alliance
Of underworlds killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green, and pass it around, pass it around

[Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin'
What kinda heat y'all holdin'
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon

Wanna get high, come smoke with me
Smoke with me, light it up

Damn, nigga, take this weed, I'm 'bout to go over to my bitch house, get my fuck on, nigga! Y'all niggas stay up!

[Verse 1]
Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since ""... Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

[Verse 2]
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Listen up, gangstas and honies with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one, screamin', ""shoot don't please""
I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""go he there""
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""no hell,"" she talkin' about, ""me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said: ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill.""

[Outro]
*Beep*
Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen, man, this dude right on the block
Right now, man, I found him, right now
I see him right now, let's kill him!
*Beep*

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)",eastcoast

Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin'
Livin carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks y'all don't hear me

Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well

He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon

This is a journey into the world's most largest and notorious projects: Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

[Verse 1]
He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
(But it's so hard) to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Verse 2]
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy (far.. far away)
(Backward ass niggas, man fuck them niggas
Go head with the program man proceed)
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Refrain]
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (the bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So they say

[Verse 3]
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you a cheque's due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown: ""How that sound?"" Poor thing!
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it

Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or dont even rep this, man!
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man!
Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man?
Niggas be buckin'!
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man! Stay out the magazines!
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth!
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin':
That means the cowards get out, and real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side:
Hating me cause I'm beautiful!
Real niggas in Queensbridge:
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby!

Follow; I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the playa haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin' outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous

Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover

We put this on the, soul of our born, as we hold the Qur'an

Yo, it's kill or be killed
Understand, real'll be real
A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel
Identity sealed, protected by our energy shield
And fuck a drop, 'cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
Close the book
Was taught never expose a crook
Between the knight and the bishop
One'll knock ya rook
I'm a rare breed, never had a fear to lead

We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's a target?

Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Nas]
I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, every day is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town""
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must open up his eyes
To the set backs and rise
Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds, to home it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo

[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)

Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot 'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap

Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls

Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe

There's not a bitch in sight
Or block bench, or black gate
Or gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

[Verse 1: Nas]
In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses – it's all poison

[Chorus 2: Nas]
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison

[Verse 2: Nas]
When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial
Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

[Chorus 3: Nas]
Yo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison

Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

[Interlude: Nas]
Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong!

[Verse 3: Nas]
The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday ""hell-day""
‘Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

[Chorus 4: Nas]
It's all poison: all of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MCs? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you: now you old and you gettin' shitted on

It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price

Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker

Either stay full or starve
Corner store like ""Mister, spare-a-quarter""
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

[Break: sample]
""Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

[Verse 2]
I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis
This goes to her with love, also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, HA!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it, my religion is reefer
Big money and the most uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existing, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

Yo, what we talking 'bout niggas?
What we talking 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

[Break: Large Professor]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we pushed it, mush it
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?

[Verse 3: Nas]
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

[Verse 1]
Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

[Verse 2]
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

[Verse 3]
""Any other real niggas in the world besides us?"" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

[Verse 4]
Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here

You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, 'cause of a

Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?

Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me

Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 2]
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 3]
And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

[Verse 1: Nas]
3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life

Yeah, what y'all know about this..
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet

Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 2: Nas]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into bestiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 3: Nas]
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

I’m protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets
And they ain't even out yet, she like CÎROC peach
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash
And y’all already know who got the summer on smash

Top all gone, got the on summer on smash

Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y’all know who got the summer on smash (WE DO!)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
Should let the world know that summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash

We got the summer on smash (smash)

I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only baby, let me take pictures
Skin, sin, wait, do you know whose pool you're in?
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you can’t conceal
Real make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, it’s totally Total Recall
Like, pura vida, she wanna flyyyy
Caliente, mami vente, vente comigo, ayooooooooooooo

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, ""Free my nigga!""
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 2: Nas]
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana
Or been shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the Gods
Moët spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shell toes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids, of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 3: Nas]
Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive
550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch
Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'ma die one day
They gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas
Only OG's, certified who kill niggas
When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga
Chill mode, spill more Spades
Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

[Chorus: Victoria Monét (Nas)]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
Man, what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
(Y'all wouldn't understand, huh)
No matter how you try you never can
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Outro: Nas]
True B nigga, yeah, uhh
For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B, what up, yeah
The whole city, I see you
To my man Big Slate in the fed joint

Yeah, yeah
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothing like them 80s summer NY days
Hop on the MB5 days
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing
Nas, I arise the dead by thousands
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi (near his Audi)
Hollis had Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid
You love to hear the story how it started
The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet

I assure you there was a process, yeah

[Verse 2: Nas]
To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw
My man Dion said Nas over-think the songs he writing
I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man
I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten

[Refrain: MC Shan sample (Nas)]
""You love to hear the story

He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

Hope I don't catch a homo
Grossing our net, simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me, fuck sadness
Had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness, at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
Just 'cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it

With the square top pocket that snaps

Pass that, not you, you hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen

Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay

Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home

Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

[Verse 1]
I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle’s perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'? I be tryin' to reply and
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I’d gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this?

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)

'Cause I'm saying bye-bye

[Verse 2: Nas]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us

'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 3: Nas]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

[Chorus: Guy sample (Nas)]
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)

You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja

Ban all pink and yellow pills

[Intro]
To my niggas.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose (uhh), where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know (uhh)
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(But yo..) this life is the only life I know...

[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, ""Please daddy pay it""
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...

[Verse 2]
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up

[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know...",eastcoast

Uh, 2000 G

[Verse 1]
Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball 'till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

[Verse 2]
I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honies wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech
Uh

[Verse 3]
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 1]
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative and positive

Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 2]
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

[Verse 3]
Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)",eastcoast

Black hoods, cops and projects
Sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
Vision blurry, 'cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*}
Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune, uhh

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Verse 3: Nas]
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said, ""go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window (lookin' out)
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out, lookin' out of my project window
(Oh, I'm lookin' out)
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

[Outro: Ron Isley]
Starin' out of, out my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window

And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
To read his latest poem for us

[Scratching by DJ Premier]
""Ladies and gentlemen..""
""Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus""
""Everybody watch him""
""Ladies and gentlemen..""

""We-we-we came a long way""

[Verse 1]
Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names, living off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Verse 2]
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

[Verse 3]
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of 'em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
- and dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

[Chorus]
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, 'cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there

Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime

I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'

I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin'
Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

[Chorus: Nas & Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

[Chorus: Nas & Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave

God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh

'Cause he be with us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us

[Verse 1]
He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas

[Verse 2]
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long my crimes now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me

Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh), in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

[Intro: Nas]
Where my real niggas at
There's a lot of real niggas out there
There's a lot of real niggas everywhere
That's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin'
Not botherin' nobody, until one muthafucka fuck with 'em
And then all hell break loose

[Chorus: Nas]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones who get killed
It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 1: Grand Wizard]
Well known gangstas, entrust, that we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us, let's see
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker beggin' for more
It's Thorazine
Standin' here shakin', hatin' the haters, they watchin' my paper
Realize, a 4-5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop?
Nigga standin' there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show y'all muthafuckas respect
Plans connect
The twinklin' diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast, leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin' like the Trench Coat Mafia
In a schoolyard, we make it hard
What's poppin' y'all?
We made our change; what's stoppin' y'all?
They spray y'all names Rest in Peace on the project wall

Quiet niggas will kill

[Verse 2: Horse]
I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Sling them things 'til the very end, you better get yours
Time is runnin' out
Your streets is gettin' smaller as we speak
Giuliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit out of David Dinkins
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin', not killin' everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is death, umpires keep ice grills
There's no tomorrow, it's the bottom of the 9-9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My heart's full of braveness, so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen, startin' chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin'
You could find us in the hood, thuggin' and regulatin'

It's wild where we walk, kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

[Verse 3: Jungle]
Yo, we here to eat food, my peoples be lethal
Shots in your body make you see-through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life bid, never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin' bigger
Celebs on the V.I., respect that nigga
Reggy on the regular, chops it up, like a editor
Come through one man gang like The Predator
If your wake, I'll wet it up, Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin' at you
Air out your area, Queensbridge forever, what
Ill Will the label
Bravehearts, y'all scared of us

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo, when those niggas ran, these niggas stayed
When those niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick 'cause we paid
Don't even rep QB, you ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin' and it's goodnight
Know how much force this is
Jungle, Horse, and Wiz
Nothin' but horses, kid
We go to war for this

(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her

[Verse 1]
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now

[Verse 2]
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours

It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

[Verse 1]
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later

A new way to play, a new way a livin'
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'

A new way to play, a new way a livin'

Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage

Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin'

Cash is the past, a new way a spendin'

Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I
More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks?
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today

Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice

Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone in confused forest's, enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames flew from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
Or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half permed, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we danced
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon pace
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their poison, spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggas smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love takes over lust
Despite the damage to Destiny
You can't take the best of me, In God We Still Trust",eastcoast

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York

Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death and I'm buggin'
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mother's life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary would've an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Verse 2]
I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

[Chorus]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion

Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth

Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild out there sold crack
Bust guns at Bow Wow's age

Latifah's chest jingle in Set It Off
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups, strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Patron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Filas
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tels
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know, when will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick, someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Here's the issue, a woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ak

Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me

Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got

And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...

Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it

[Verse 1]
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue,"" it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

[Break]
Oh shit, Tina!
I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme is weak
This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here
(My book of rhymes)
Gandhi was a… what the fuck?

[Verse 2]
Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote this… nah, it's weak)
The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares
(Nah, that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real
I can't fight you, ‘cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
This can't be my book of rhymes

[Break]
This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!
(My book of rhymes)
Nah, neva that! Fuck that!
Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist?
Hah, you a funny nigga...
Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes)
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?!

[Verse 3]
Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood
Our values so low, our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we should've heeded
‘Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t—
I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)",eastcoast

I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey
A mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks
Missionaries pass out papers that read ""Love God""
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro
Sixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his asthma's flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love, and street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse 3: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright

[Verse 1]
Velvet bow ties
Bulletproof's in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of, years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose, man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
'Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your Jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my masterminds

[Verse 2]
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that black stone Merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, ""drive home""
'Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said ""Goodbye""
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs
That I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gon' be
But I'm a mastermind

(A mastermind) sees it coming before it comes
(A mastermind) before he go to war he counts his ones
(A mastermind) everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered

I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas'll slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant, came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury
I'm low, smoking Blueberry with a ho
That know a few scary individuals, it's eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too

Uh, if I can teach somethin' so be it
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back

[Verse 1: Nas & Both]
They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith is with Satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto medleys, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it
I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
Y'all bunch of backward gangsters
Y'all signin affidavits
Snitches with smiling faces, got you blowin trial, I hate this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind of weird and it's scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I see clear to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh

Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Verse 3: Nas & Both]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found

Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words: Never give up

For the cause, I gotta take you off here

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
""Jesus"", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up
The armies is school teaching smart ways to kill
I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool, the chronic's a fool
Got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's
I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills
For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters
My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton

For the cause, I gotta take you off here

Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared
I don't care if no one's spared in..

Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced

You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have—

Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?

Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?

To get away and escape from the craziness

With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks free
Of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord

A: Why would you want to know that? And why would you assume that I'm human?

Q: Who's your favorite Horrorcore rapper?
A: I should do my research on Horrorcore Rap. I'm not an expert when it comes to Horrorcore. I don't really like horror movies so a subgenre in Hip-Hop is something I didn't dare to try.

Q: Wahts your opinion on amine? Is he good or bad?
A: He sounds a little corny to me but better than mumble rappers.

Q: Whats your opinion on the new disstrack from uzi(rich forever)? I know uzi is really bad, but in my opinion this disstrack was fire!
A: I don't know if the one I listend to was a disstrack. It sounded like a club song. I prefer this over his other songs though (it's more serious and lyrical).

Q: I believe Eminem still makes good music since I am a really Big Eminem fan, so I just wanted to ask if you were a fan of the New Eminem. Great vids by the way, keep it up!
A: Every MC will be past their prime after more than a decade. EMINEM was able to keep his career alive and add new styles to it. I like a lot of his newer songs, his older ones of course are more memorable because he was a hungry MC. He wanted to prove his skills to everyone.

Q: What are your top 3 rap songs in 2018?
A: The year isn't over yet but I would say Choraseptic remix (Eminem), Terminally Ill (Chino XL) and ATM (J Cole)

Q: How would you rank Nas albums from the best to worst?
A: Illmatic, It Was Written, Stillmatic, The Lost Tapes, God's Son, I Am, Life Is Good, Untitled, Streets Disciple, Hip-Hop Is Dead, Nastradamus.

Q: What do you think of proof do you think he is a good rapper?
A: He was a dope freestyler and I like his songs with D12. He never got the chance to fully evolve as a rapper.

Q: What are your 5 favourite albums
A: That's a difficult question and it's based on my mood. Right now I would pick Illmatic, Ready To Die, Me Against The World, Enter The Wu-Tang and Rip The Jacker.

Q: Most overrated rapper of all time?
A: Lil Wayne and then Drake. Drake has some dope songs though.

Q: Can you start doing album reviews pls ily
A: Album reviews are difficult to do. I'm not recording myself and I would just bore you If I write long essays. Copyrighted content is also a thing... Videos get blocked easily
But I may try it one day (with face reveal)

Q: Would you make a video about Nas?
Evolution of Nas or Top 50 Nas songs
A: He will drop an album on June 15th. I will do a video with new music.

Q: What was your first Experience with rap music?
A: My first experience with rap was in 2003. I was 7 at that time. I was impressed by 50 Cent, EMINEM and DMX. I couldn't understand a word but I loved the sound. 50 Cent was the coolest to me, EMINEM was very funny and DMX had me scared. I loved the sound of Rap music in the early 2000s.

Q: First Comment so i would really apreciate if  you answer it  my question is Who  is your favorite  oldschoolrapper ?
A: That's tough... I would say 2Pac or Biggie. Both have different styles that I can listen to all day. But if you ask me from whom I listen to music most, I would say 2Pac. He has more than twice the amount of songs. But I love them equally.

Q: Ur top 10 list for rappers ded and alive
A: 1. 2Pac
2. Biggie
3. Canibus
4. Nas
5, 6, 7. Rakim/Jay-Z/Eminem (Can't really decide)
8. Ice Cube
9. KRS-One
10. LL Cool J

HM: Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap, Kool Moe Dee, Big L, Big Pun, MF Doom etc. (I could name you a thousand more)

Q: Do you like Burger King lettuce
A: I like lettuce but it the texture is weird when it's served on a burger. But I focus more on the taste of the beef.

Q: What do you think about hopsin?
A: I first thought he was corny but he actually has some dope lyrics and clever punchlines. He's still a little weird (Happy endings etc.)

Q: Do you think that ‘ who shot ya ‘ was aimed at Tupac?
A: No, that song was recorded prior to the shooting.

Q: Your personal favorite new school rappers?
A: I made 2 lists on this and I would pick: Kendrick, J Cole, Tyler The Creator, Logic & Joey Badass

Q: Who do you think is/was the most talented mc?
A: Definitely Canibus. He was respected by Rakim as an equal in 98 and he was just at the beginning of his career. He battled the entire Wu-Tang Clan and Onyx without having a career. And he beat them! Same with LL Cool J. The industry just held him down. His subject matter and vocabulary is second to none!

Q: Can you do ""Evolution of Conscious Rap""? You probably wont answer but Its worth a shot
A: I will see if I can come up with something interesting. I will do my research.

Q: When is the top 200 rap artist coming out?
A: It's a video that will take me more than 20 hours. I don't have much time right now. But I will do it one day. It's a lot of work, that's why no one has ever even tried to do such a list.

Q: What's your favorite song from each of the following rappers?
Eminem/Biggie/2pac
A: Eminem: Lose Yourself
2Pac: Changes/Me Against The World
Biggie: Juicy

Q: Who is your favorite emcee?
A: It depends on my mood. I can relax to 2Pac, Nas and Biggie any day. Eminem is funny and creative. Canibus makes me use my brain the most. Jay z and Rakim are also my favorites.

Q: What country are u from?
A: I'm from Germany

Q: What would you say if someone said to you ice cube is the GOAT?
A: It's a respectable opinion- Music is subjective and Ice Cube has done enough for Hip-Hop to be called the G.O.A.T.

Q: what does inspired you to make videos about musicians? ans why?
A: There was once a time when I had no clue about Hip-Hop. I was searching on the internet for good Hip-Hop music, I didn't like the songs they played on the radio/MTV. My favorite rappers from my childhood (EMINEM, 50 Cent & DMX) almost disappeared in 2009. Rappers I disliked took over the game. People were arguing about the current King Of Rap on the internet, I learned a lot from other peoples opinions. After listening to hundreds of rappers and built my own opinion. I didn't want to communicate through blogs, I actually was cutting videos and creating websites in my childhood. I loved watching Youtube videos (not related to Hip-Hop) and I wanted to create my own channel. There wasn't really a big Hip-Hop channel that expressed it's opinion on Youtube. I wasn't inspired by other youtubers but from bloggers and people who love to talk about Hip-Hop.

Q: Who's your favorite wu tang member?
A: This is a tough one... they are all different and I love all of the members. I can relate to Method Man and Ghost the most.

Q: Where are you from?
A: Germany

Q: what rapper do you think couldve had a career where theyll be consider top 3 of all time but couldnt cuz they died to early.for me is big L
A: Big L, Big Pun and Eazy-E. Eazy-E was starting to write his own lyrics. He wanted to release an album with 66 songs. I would love to see him evolve.

Q: Who is the most underrated rapper in your opinion? In my opinion AZ
A: AZ is a good pick. I would also pick Canibus, MF DOOM, Vinnie Paz, Chino XL and Immortal Technique.

Q: Why you like Hip-Hop ?
A: It entertained me sonically and visually when I was watching MTV as a kid. I loved to watch rap videos for some reason. I couldn't speak english back then but I still was a fan of artists like DMX, EMINEM and 50 Cent. I was never a fan of singing but I could notice a difference between rap and pop without understanding a word. Rap songs resonated with me and I thought rappers are the coolest people on the planet (especially 50 Cent).

Q: What are your top 10 Nas songs? I am wondering cause Nas is my favorite rapper of all time so
A: It aint Hard To Tell, The Message, Purple, Ny State Of Mind, Nas Is Like, Made You Look, The World Is Yours, One Love, If I Ruled The World, Doo Rags

Q: How old are you and where you from
A: I'm 23 (born in 1994) and from Germany

Q: Do you think any rapper got shit on 2Pac, or do you think he is overrated?
A: If Hip-Hop would have a face it would either be 2Pac or Biggie. Based on impact and overall package I can't put anyone above them. Of course you could find an MC that's better in one aspect but not overall.

Q: Where do you rank Eminem among the greatest of all time
A: Behind Pac, Big, Canibus and Nas. I can't make a decision on Nr. 5. Rakim snd Jay also deserve the spot. So between 5-7.

Q: Can you name for me top oldschoolrappers and newschoolrapper and which one is better to listen to?
A: Old School: 2Pac, Biggie, Nas, Rakim & Ice Cube

New School: Kendrick, J Cole, Tyler The Creator, Logic, Joey Badass

Q: If you could create a rap group of six rappers out of everybody in the industry, dead or alive, who'd they be?
A: Good question! I would pick 2Pac, Biggie, Nas, Jay-Z, Big L and Big Pun

Q: Do you listen to anything else than hip hop?
A: Sometimes I listen to old songs from different genres. I like old pop songs with relaxing instrumentals.
I prefer the non-electric ""warm"" sound (with background noises) to todays mainstream songs . I also like classic and symphony. Bob Marley, Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley are also good picks.

Q: What are your favorite modern rap albums? TPAB, GKMC, Damn, Atrocity Exhibition etc. also where does Kendrick rank all time?
A: TPAB, GKMC,  Flower Boy... and it's hard to put Kendrick on my list because he is a relatively new artist. There are MCs that rapped for 30 years and inspired millions. Kendrick is at the beginning of his career. He can be one of the best in the future. Right now he would be in my Top 50. But he will climb higher over the years.

Q: what do you think of the song caterpillar by royce da 5 9 ft eminem
A: I love the song. EMINEM went in on Mumble Rap and Royce made a nice comeback!

Q: Would you show us your head ?
A: I will show my old head one day, but not right now.

Q: Wat's ur favs rapper
A: I have a lot of favorite rappers. But the ones I listen to the most are 2Pac, Biggie and Canibus.

Q: Who do you think is better Lil Skies or Trippie Redd
A: Trippie Redd uses autotune and has a high voice. Lil Skies has more the type of music that I could listen to (No autotune but the same amount of singing). Not saying that I like their music... it's music for kids to me.

Q: Big Pun or Big L ? Who would win in a battle
Both in my Top 5
A: Big L has the better punchlines but Big Pun has a better flow. Pun also had the bigger fanbase in the late 90s. But I think Big L would win. He won hundreds of battles in Harlem/New York.

Q: So u quite a big canibus fan, how'd you feel about the whole dizaster battle he had. Personally I felt so bad for canibus coz he should of know better one and two he should of come better prepared or something coz that shit was embarrassing . With that said though dizaster truly outclassed him that day.

A: This will be long. I became a Canibus fan after watching the battle. It wasn't embarrassing to me but I just hated how people disrespected him. These are my full thoughts:

Canibus did the battle because of his love for Hip-Hop and the battle rap culture. He wanted to give them the respect that he didn't get 20 years prior to that battle when he was a battler. And he wanted to jump in the ring just to have the same thrill as in his youth. A battle with a fan just for fun. Everyone who is a part of the Battle Rap culture is a fan of Canibus.

He and EMINEM are the pioneers of todays battling. And as a fan you know everything about your idol and if not you have the internet. Canibus was always mocked and disrespected by the media. The average Hip-Hop fan holds a grudge against Canibus for his beef with EMINEM. He was hated by millions (and now by even more people) even though EMINEM is a fan of Canibus. Canibus is also a fan of EMINEM.

Bis was the underdog from the start he even said it himself: ""winning or losing is not important to me"". He was 15 years past his prime, stepped away from rap to be with his family, has no modern day battle rap experience and came wounded to the ring. He prepared himself different from how a KOTD battle rapper prepares. He wrote 30 pages like he was about to record a 1.000 Bar verse. This is not the proper way to do these battles. A person past his 20s can't remember more than a few pages of notes. I'm in my twenties too, I'm a computer science student. I can't remember more than a few pages, you will have forget 90% of it after a week. Canibus was underprepared. He had to shorten his verse to about 4-5 pages. That's why he chocked, he already forgot most of it. And even if he could memorize 30 pages, how are you supposed to be rap agressively when your entire body is damaged. Canibus probably was on painkillers.

Dizaster on the other hand was in his best shape. He has already done a hundred of these battles and he knows everything about Canibus while Canibus knows nothing about him. It's like Bruce Lee said: ""I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times"". Canibus can cover 10,000 aspects of MCing but Dizaster can do one 10,000 times more efficient than what Canibus is used to. Canibus could spit lyrical bars with no personal disses but Dizaster was able to mention something that EMINEM and the media was using to make fun of him. So he could mention things like losing against LL Cool J (which even LL admitted wasn't true). It's like the popular kid making fun of minorities. Established rappers don't rap without a beat. And battle rappers can't rap on a beat. Thats why mayweather defeated mcgregor easily. You can't be better than the best at Sport A if you are the best at Sport B. It's too different. But yeah. Canibus wanted gave up and he showed his respect by doing so. Anyone else would just be cocky and do something to look cool. Canibus wanted to give his fans what they are used to. He wrote 30 pages for his fans but his haters didn't let him spit even though he gave up. The battle was over. They were getting more for their money but they wanted the battle to end after the first round. Thats like declining a second week of free vacation after your first is over. And people loved to see Canibus on the ground because now they have an excuse not to listen to his music. Ignorant people always find a reason not to educate themselves.
But yeah these are my thoughts...

Q: Who do you think is the best rapper lyrically? For me it’s Rakim or MF Doom

A: You could devide this into multiple categories:

Vocabulary: Canibus
Rhyme Chains: Kool G Rap & MF Doom
Subject Matter: Canibus (Science, math, Philosophies etc.)
Creativity and Relevance: Rakim & Nas
Punchlines: Canibus & Big L
Poetry/Storytelling: Nas & 2Pac
Song structuring (to enable faster and more flow based rhymes): Biggie & EMINEM

It all comes down to preference. I can't say that one MC is the best in every single one of these categories.

Q: Are Biggie and 2Pac overrated? (Love them both and your channel, keep it up.)
A: No. There is so much hate against these two. They didn't become Hip-Hop gods because they passed away. A lot of people are saying this. Big was the King of New York between 1994 and 1997. He layed the blueprint for being successful as a New York MC with incredible Lyrics and Flows. Pac was the highest selling artist and the biggest rapper in 96. He wrote 5 songs a day and can release classics 20 years after his death. Show me one legend that can do that! People think writing a more lyrical song in one year makes you a better lyricist than Pac. Pac wrote 20 albums in one year. Write a song in 15 minutes and show that you're better than him. And Pac was high and drunk while writing his songs. He just wanted to make great songs.

Q: Will you rank bis' discography? And do you still think that 2nd round k.o. is his best song? Have you listened to lil waynes old music? And who is a better lyricist, pac, biggie or bis?
A: I will rank his discography when he releases a new album. 2nd Round K.O. Is the song that he's most known for. I would put Poet Laureate 2,  Curriculum 101 and 100 Bars above it though. He has a lof great songs. But 2nd Round has a unique video that defines Canibus the best. In a hundred years people will remember those images of him. I was never a fan of Lil Wayne. I try to listen to him once in a while but he is not my cup of tea. His voice, subject matter, lyrics, beats and overall sound is difficult to listen to. Even his older songs without autotune sound weird to me, I can't relate to it. He also set the Blueprint for the rappers that inspired mumble rappers. He was the leader or the pioneer of that movement. Canibus is the MC that invests the most brain cells into his lyrics. You could call him the greatest lyricist. You couldn't see Pacs full potential because he wrote his songs high and drunk in 15 minutes. He just wanted good songs but he could get lyrical if he wanted. Big put more effort into the technical aspect of rhyming than Pac. He combined his lyrical skills with his flow. Pac combined it with emotion/delivery/differnt subjects. Canibus focuses on Vocabulary, Punchlines and unique subject matter.

Q: What is your favorite Tyler, the Creator album ?
A: Flowerboy

Q: Opinion on Big L? IMO he’d be in everyone’s top 3 if he had lived a little longer

A: One of the greatest rappers of all time. He uses a lot of punchlines and he's very creative. I still can't believe how he could create a song about the criminal slang (Ebonics). He is able to rhyme slang words with slang words for 3 minutes straight and it's very entertaining.

Q: What do you think about hopsin?

A: Thought he was corny at first, turns out that he is a dope lyricist.

Q: What is your opinion on Techn9ne?
Also, do you listen to any german rap?

A: Tech N9ne is amazing. He's probably my favorite double time rapper. He destroys every beat.

Q: Who are your Top 10 producers of all time

Edit:Everyone sleeping on Stoupe. Language Is Fatal is one of my favorite beats

A: I will do a video on that. But I love Stoupe The Enemy Of Mankind, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, Madlib, J. Dilla, Premier, Dre etc.

Q: What Canibus albums should I listen to? Like which is his best?

A: I would recommend Rip The Jacker, Mic Club The Curriculum and 2000 BC. He has a lot of dope albums, the only one you may skip is ""C True Hollywood Stories"".

Q: In your Evolution of Hip-Hop videos, it seems you start showing a larger amount of shittier songs from 2006/2007 onward. Was this done to prove a point about the lack of creativity in mainstream hip hop, from that point onward? Or were you putting down the significant/popular songs, regardless of quality?

A: Both. That was the time when the mainstream in Hip-Hop changed. I could've cherry picked the best songs for those years, but that's not what represents those years the best.

Q: What is your favourite Nas song?
My favourite is ""The Message""

A: NY State Of Mind

Q: Inspectah Deck is in my top 10 rappers, am i weird?

A: Inspectah Deck is an underrated legend. I can understand why you would put him there.

Q: favourite youtubers?
A: Mark Wiens, Food Ranger, Strictly Dumplings, VLADTV & PewDiePie

Q: If you had to listen to one mumble rapper for the rest of your life who would it be
A: uhhh..................... damn........... 21 Savage I think.... his beats are not bad

Q: what did you think of book of ryan?
A: Haven't listened to it yet. But his song with EM is amazing.

Q: top 3 hip hop bands
A: Wu-Tang Clan, NWA & Public Enemy

Q: What do you use to make your videos and is Youtube your main priority?
A: Youtube is not my main priority. I'm studying Computer Science and learning Japanese on the side.
It's exhaustive to work on Youtube on the side and not get kicked out of university. You have to spend your free time studying and editing, it's harder than studying medicine. Japanese is also one of the most difficult languages. It's hard to not give up. As for my editing tool. I use iMovie.

Q: What’s your favorite song dedicated to a past rapper? (mines Cuban link - flowers for the dead/ lord finesse - big L tribute﻿)
A: Jadakiss - Letter To Big
THUG LIFE - To Pac
Cuban Link - Letter To Pun

Q: What do you think about ice cube?
A: One of the most polarising and import Rappers of the late 80s and 90s. He revolutionised West Coast Hip-Hop and he's one of the only MC's that can still release classics 30 years after their prime.

Q: Whatz your favorite 2pac verse? And do u think a new 2pac album will come out next year or the year 2020?
A: Me Against The World (all verses). I don't know when his album will come out. From what I've heard people have given up on the album. Every company he was working with wants its share on the earnings. There would be a lot of legal problems like during the All Eyez On Me Movie. They wanted to release his album then, didn't come out....

Q: Do you still consider Lil Jon, T-Pain, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne to be among the worst rappers of all-time?
A: Yes

Q: What are your top 10 Nas songs? I’m wondering because Nas is my favorite rapper of all time.
A: NY State Of Mind, It Aint Hard To Tell, The Message, Nas Is Like, Made You Look, Purple, Doo Rags, The World Is Yours, Ether, If I Ruled The World

Q: Opinion on Meek Mill and Rick Ross?
A: Average at best

Q: If I recall correctly you are German - who are your favorite German rappers ? What do you think of Capo ?
A: I only listened to older rappers like Eko Fresh, Sido, Fler, Kool Savas & Bushido. But I gave up on german Hip-Hop.

Q: Who is the king of rap
A: Pac on the West, BIG on the East.

Q: Thanks for answering my first question man. So another one: in your second evolution video, you put Yeah by Usher in there. Some viewers argued that Usher isn't hip hop because he's a singer, not a rapper. Do you believe singers can also be hip hop?

A: He is a RnB singer. RnB is a derivative of Rap, Pop and Blues.
The song included rappers like Ludacris and Lil' Jon. RnB mixes well with Rap music and I wouldn't be surprised if RnB singers also are mentioned as a part of Hip-Hop. Nate Dogg for example didn't rap but he is a Hip-Hop artist.

Q: Can you make a Top 10,20 or 50  best rap groups/bands?
A: I will do one in the future.

Q: Can you make a top 50 hip hop songs since 2010 or top 50 new school songs?
A: I may do it in the future.

Q: What other types of music do you listen to besides rap/hip hop?
A: Old Pop songs and classic symphonies. I can listen to a lot of genres including Rock n Roll, Reggie and Jazz as long as its melodic and creative.

Q: What is your opinion on these diss songs?
50 Cent, EMINEM & Busta Rhymes - Hail Mary (Remix)
50 Cent - Your life's on the line
Mobb Deep - In The Long Run. Are these songs wack or good?
A: Classics!

Q: Best big L song
A: Put It On and Ebonics

Q: Wich 2 ( alive ) rappers should make a colab album ?
A: EMINEM & Canibus

Q: Last question : Im french, what s your favorite song of french rappers, this is hard for you because u dont understand lyrics but u should listen to iam & wu tang/ iam & methodman and redman (iam the best french rappers, they are two)
A: I will give french rap a try.

Q: Can Will Smith, Puff Daddy and Shaquil O'Neal  be consider as good hip hop artist because this is not there job before
(Now, this is jake and logan paul lmao)
A: I actually like Will Smith and Puff Daddy. They don't need to be the best lyricists, they added their own styles to Hip-Hop. They are good artists.

Q: Top 10 underground rappers?
A: Canibus, Immortal Technique, Vinnie Paz, Chino XL, MF Doom, K-Rino, Kool Keith, Sean Price, R.A. The Rugged Man & Jus Allah

Q: Best old School Hip-Hop songs
A: Nuthing But A G Thang
Shook Ones Pt. 2

Q: Do you like Old Lil Wayne?
A: No. His voice was better back then but he lacks delivery and substance.

Q: Top members of Wu tang clan in order (with shyheim and capadonna also if they werent real members of Wu tang)
A: Ghostface Killah
GZA
Method Man
Raekwon
Inspectah Deck
Ol Dirty Bastard
RZA
Shyheim
U-God
Masta Killa
Cappadonna

Q: Would you consider doing album reviews? Feel like that would be good content on your channel
A: It's hard to do reviews without recording yourself. I know there is nothing more easy than recording yourself, but that's something I don't want to do in the near future. Maybe one day though, I want to talk about new albums too.

Q: Would you think the old wc vs ec beef would have been better if it was Pac vs Nas? I think Nas is 100x better than biggie imo
A: No. Nas wasn't writing battle rhymes back then. He was more into poetry. Biggie always had hard punchlines and he fit more in the Gangster Rap bracket. Pac and Big had about an equal fan base and they were respected equally. It was perfect.

Q: Best New School Hip-Hop songs?
A: Kendrick Lamar - Alright
Joey Bada$$ - Christ Conscious
A$AP Ferg - Work
Tyler The Creator - Who Dat Boy
Logic - Walk On By

Q: Fave New school rapper?
A: Kendrick Lamar

Q: Best samples for u ?
A: I don't have a sample that I love the most but I like Jazz and old pop samples.

Q: Top collectif song( for me : Heal yourself & self destruction)
A: Those are the best. There are not many songs where artists come together to spread a message. The one I also like is ""West Coast All Stars - We're All The Same Gang"". It's against gang violence.

Q: Top 10 best featuring song ( for me, this is methodmanXredman da rockwilder)

Q: Oh, and will you please do top 50 wu tang and Biggie songs?

[Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)

See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work

[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 2]
Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash

[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 3]
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite
Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of ‘em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar

It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know

Danger, danger
Check it out

It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fuckin' with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the Super Sports rally
Beatin' up the block, leavin' these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci
Now dey a motherfuckin' see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin' kama-kize, sparkin' this shit that keep me off the heezee
Game over, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin' dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here

[Verse 2: Nas]
Nuttin' but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin' but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin', think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shootin' niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin' to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Verse 3: Scarface]
You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin' cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfuckin' plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin' mind
Him and whoever standin' by, I'll tell these niggas, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin' up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin' mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted

I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted

A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin'
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa

To my dogs.. wherever you are

[Verse 1]
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

[Verse 3]
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

(What?) Ever been in love? (C'mon)
Yeah.. are you ready? (uhh) For somethin real?
(Say what?) 'Cause it can't be fake
This ain't no game (C'mon)
You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)
'Cause it's real out here (uh-huh)
So make up your mind, 'cause I ain't got no time
Y'know? (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Verse 2: Nas]
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his keys
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

[Interlude: Aaliyah and Nas]
Call you on a Monday
I'll call you back baby
Call you on a Tuesday
My cell is off baby
Call you on a Wednesday
I'm out of town baby
You won't be back 'til Thursday
I'll page you back baby
Call you on a Monday
I'll call you back baby
Call you on a Tuesday
My cell is off baby
Call you on a Wednesday
I'm out of town baby
You won't be back 'til Thursday
I'll page you back baby

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
Thinking of me, you getting the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas, not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg, everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open
But -- you just my close friend
Get it baby

[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)
And you'll be so full of sorrow (yeah right)
You'll go tell all your friends (that's right)
How you called and I follow (they know it)
But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Bridge: Nas (Aaliyah)]
The God, the God, the God, Nasir (you won't see me tonight)
The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (you won't see me tomorrow)
Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight)
(And you'll be so full of sorrow)
Uhh uhh (you'll go tell all your friends)
Tell your friends (how you called and I followed)
How you followed me (but you won't see me tonight)
Not tonight baby (no, you won't see me tomorrow)
C'mon, c'mon c'mon
Tomorrow, what
Daylight, ghost

You wanna kill me because my hunger?
Mr. America young black niggas want ya
I wanna talk to the man, understand?
Understand this motherfuckin' G-pack in my hand
Look what happened to San Fran
Young girl hit by policeman
Twelve shots up in her dome, damn
Niggas thought we slept but the architect sent
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggas play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars plottin' civilizations
Dissin' us discriminatin' different races
Tax payers pay for more jail for Black Latin faces

I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president

I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard, damn
Niggas gotta go create his own job
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live cardiac to get high
It's the ghetto life, yeah I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it
And y'all combinin' all the countries we goin' do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang
It ain't a black and white thing

[Verse 3]
What y'all waitin' for the world to blow up
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
They try to buy us with dough
Fake black leaders of puppets always talkin' 'bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin' to the public
They eyes watchin' stay wise move above it
Water floods predicted, hurricanes, twisters
Its all signs of the Armageddon, three sixes
People reverse the system, politics verse religion
Holy war, muslim verse christians
Niggas in high places, they don't got the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman

If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin'
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T

Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit

A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin'
Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin'
Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex

Problems or questions, I can answer them best

Yo, Ill Will, Ruff Ryders
What what, straight like that

[Verse 1: Nas]
You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing

[Chorus: Nas (DMX)]
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)

[Verse 2: DMX]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed (what)
So I keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna test (uh)
I got no time for games 'cause I'm all grown up
You wanna joke nigga? Laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh-huh)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Make history before you go
Fuck the misery, you living po' we gettin dough
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga

Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)

Get yours nigga
'Cause I'ma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things

[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you
'Cause now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners
I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 2]
When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

[Chorus]
Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things (ill)
Gotta get my life together man (uh huh)
'Cause now I'm into big things (big things)
Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more)
'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all)
You know I can't do that shit no more (why?)
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?)
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)
I'm into big things (uh)
Tired of talkin' small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

[Verse 3]
I go past y'all (UH-HUH)
Y'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH)
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH)
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things

Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(""Nas is..."", ""Nas is...""
""Nas is..."", ""Nas is...""
""Nas is..."", ""Nas is..."", ""Nas is..."")

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign is for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier]
""Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. ""
""My poetry's deep, I never fell..""
""Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing..""
""No doubt..""
""Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. ""
""My poetry's deep, I never fell..""
""Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing..""
""No doubt..""

[Verse 2]
""Nas is like…"" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
""Nas is like…"" Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

""My poetry's deep, I never fell..""
""Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing..""

[Verse 3]
""Nas is like…"" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like pop dukes you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night, now…

She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together

[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 2]
I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm with you and I won't even care, word

[Chorus]
Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

I remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

[Verse 3]
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talking this divorcing shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

{*Kissing*}
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

[Verse 1]
The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 2]
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 3]
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

[Verse 1]
Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some nigga
Mumblin' shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through

[Chorus]
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""
.. we elope

Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount

War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans

And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though

From federal guys who backed them up

Even the Congo needs dreams

His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say 'Son they bitin you""
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple

Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples

Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said

[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga

[Scarlett]
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
God, I respect you cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now

[Hook: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you

So she don't have to bone for dimes?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects
Where dogs shit and piss

Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LPs

[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching

[Hook: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money

By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money

When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

[Hook: Emily]
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa

[Verse 3: Nas]
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggas gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what

And laugh when a nigga start frontin'

My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble

Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya

You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning

[Verse 1]
January 28, 1968
Born into this world, William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch, Long Island
Scientific rhyming invented a new style when
He met with Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene 1986, with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
The facts is the tracklist was like full
The vocals, the beats, according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative
This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock
Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearing Kurtis Blow saying
""It can't get better than this""
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits
From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan Smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap
18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre
Supreme, Rap and the 50 that don't rap
Fort Greene, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn
With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote
""Smack me and I smack you back""
Sounded like the answer to the ""I Ain't No Joke"" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzing from Wyandanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot
At sixteen when I met Freddie Foxxx
Toting burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How has Rakim's flow made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one
Before similar voices were King Sun
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, son was watching him, mesmerized
Respect, not jocking him, was so amazing, besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

[Outro]
Unauthorized Biography of Rakim
Epilogue: Mother was a jazz singer
Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique
That's the end of the group, went on for solo
Dropped ""The R"", then The 18th Letter, then I think something, The Master
Was signed to Aftermath
Scheduled to release an album Oh My God with Dr. Dre
The album was dismantled because of creative differences

I think I can remember some...

[Verse 1]
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch and screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

[Hook]
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you

[Verse 2]
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted

I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

[Nas]
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress

[Hook]

[Nas]
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

[Hook]

[Nas]
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

This ain't no sucka-for-love shit
This ain't no Huxtable-kisses-and-hug shit
First night we fuck, shit, and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married

[Hook: Nas] (3X)
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo
It was difficult for me to find the chick I want

[Verse 2: Nas]
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to
I'm getting married

Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two

On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me

Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her

Nothing but the worst type, worst fight
When we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging
In my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gaining clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems

Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do

Check, one, two

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening

[Hook x4]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with

[Verse 2]
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going
And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life
For the thieves who come out at night

[Hook x4]
