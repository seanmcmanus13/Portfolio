Party people in the place
Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
And make you motivate, and accelerate
Cause like Tony the Tiger, I'm greeeat!
Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow
I mean, me being wack, oh come come now
That's quite ridiculous, so just admit you was
Thrilled, it's on your face, and it's conspicuous
Not that you're on this, but my performance
Is rather exquisite, so hard is it
Or supremacy, that's the perfect definition
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ain't no competition
Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, that's ambition
For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy
The Big Father, nah don't even bother
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
Trying to make it, you can't fake it
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong
So, all hail the man that's here to live long

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know you heard this voice before somewhere
And when I said that I'm the Kane, you said ""oh yeah""
""That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
Oh he's def,"" you know what time it is
But this time I'm not assisted on the microphone
More like Patti Labelle, on my own
Just single-handed, the mic I commanded
Phony MC's don't understand it, and it
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
So never sleep on me, better stay awoke
Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke
To make a long story short, yo I ain't no joke
I take time and care in whatever I'm doing
And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en-
Joy what you're hearing as I entertain
So hip-hip hooray, long live the Kane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
On exhibit, get with it, now here's my ring
The original supreme being Black man
Point blank, the cream to rise supreme
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that I'm giving
Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living
Fine in mind, to decline is out of line
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
To say I'm not, don't even diss yourself
Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself
Long live the K, the A, the N, the E
I say the end will be
A big movement, by the time I'm through
And that's coming from a Black man's point of view

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now pardon me for just changing the issue
But all you sucker MC's, it's a must that I diss you
The way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted
Now I'ma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that I'm using is just like karate
So if we ever battle you're bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
No I'm not Chinese, it's just rhymes like these
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
You're rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose
Kid sound awiiite, but I can't taste the juice
Therefore, the job is left to me
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
But I won't stop there, I still rock a little harder
While the toy MC's step and say, sayonara

Here I am . . . R-A-W
Terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phoney emcees, I move on and sieze
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making emcees run
Also don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party, until the A.M
I'll make a muscle, grab the mike and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme
With authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definately amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw
Cause I get RAW!

(Verse 2:)
I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten
Or eaten, or just tookin out
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin out
And real nervous, when I'm at your service
Also give me that title boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb
Also full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float, on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get em in a battle and make them all history
Rulin and schoolin, emcees that I'm duelin
Watch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin
On a throne, with a bronze microphone
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw!

(Verse 3:)
Chillin, killin like a villain
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust, comin off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smokin or hittin or takin a sniff
Only crushin emcees that be tryin to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior
Rather like a samurai, and I;ll be damn if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world
Could ever come with more, I get RAW!",eastcoast

Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold
Back, or fold cos I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck
Rock the discotheque and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant them
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no
Problem, I can sneeze, sniffle and cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter I'mma still come off
Cos rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what is said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
Cos I get ill and kill at will
Teachin a skill that's real, you're no frill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up...don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up

[Chorus x3]
""I can't hold it back""
Set it off
Now break loose

[Verse 2]
Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other
Dancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically
From me, so don't play me, obey me
When asked ""Who's the best?"", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north
And if you still want some...set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope
Cos I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says ""Peace""
So, maestro, yo, hit it
Big Daddy Kane's about to come with it, cause...

Talk about ever meeting Ms. Right
But one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac

[Big Daddy Kane: Chorus]
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 2]
Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed

You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 3]
The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
[You've got me waiting for you day by day]
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
Yeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it, ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you

[Big Daddy Kane: Chorus]
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 4]
A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserve the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine",eastcoast

I got my man Scoob Lover on the side of me, DJ Mister Cee on the wheels of steel, Dre on
The film and Marley on the boards. We gonna do a little something like this:

[Big Daddy Kane, Scoob Lover & both]
Some like it hard and some like it soft
Yo, bust the groove as I set it off
But wait a minute...
Yo Scoob, what's up?
Pardon me a moment as I interrupt
For what?
For this:

You like the stylish clothes we wear
And you like our flat-top style of hair
It's just those bugged out things we do
That make the girlies wanna stare

Like when we're chillin' with the crew
Or drinkin' that Old English brew
Straight from the bottle not the cup
And it gets us more than just fucked uuuuup...
And I like it yall..
..like it yall...
Like it yall...
...like it yall
Scoob Lover, won't you hype it yall?
Well, I'm the S-C double-O B-L-O-V-E-R- uh
Ladies come to me, I'll be your midnight horror
Need a flat top? Come to Scoob, I'm the barber
Of Da Ville
And that's right
Try to step to us, watch what you get
Cuz me and Big Daddy's not havin' it
Well, it's the Big Daddy, so all hail
Save your wack rhymes, hold your female
Pass the Old Gold, trash the ale
Cash your food stamps, get the WIC out the mail
Love to eat shrimps, but I never eat snail
Eat a whole fish except for the tail
Keep food in the fridge so it don't get stale
And when there's nothing to eat, I bite my nails
So Scoob Lover, you know your rhymes are kickin'
Get on the mic, cuz you know you eat chicken
Now-now-now, I'm-a place a order for a Scooby snack
Not at the Chinese restaurant because I don't eat cats
Now who in the world can ever eat these?
When I'm at home, I chow down with ease
And say ""More beef sausage, mom, please?""
That's right, Mommy Dukes, she feeds me swell
Coffee on the table, orange juice as well
Some of the things I say are outspoken
Guaranteed to have you chokin'
Bitin' MCs are the one I'm yokin'
Kane, I'm outta here, I guess I'll use my token
I'll walk through the gate if the turnstile's broken
Big Daddy, if you're down with me
Get on the mic on the count of three;
One, two, three...
Now I'm a black brother that's out to succeed
So step aside as I take the lead
Sexy young ladies of a light-skinned breed
""You got-you got-you got what I need!""
Outstanding, kind, cool and loyal
Drove all the way to Maaco just to change my oil
Cuz I'm the only child, you might think I'm spoiled
Touch the young ladies make their blood pressure boil
I got the ...hmm...hiccups, excuse me, sorry
Score a 100 Gs every time I play Atari
Put a hole in the Old Gold, blast the Bacardi
On the dance floor, hype moves I be freakin'
Makin' new steps up every single weekend
Not Abbot and Costello or Laurel and Hardy
I'm only here to PAR-TY!

Yo, check it out, check it out. Turn the music down, turn the music down
Turn the music down...here we go, here we go...

We gonna end it like this in the place yall
It's like this yall, and you don't stop
Now, the name Kane is superior to many people;
It means King Asiatic Nobody's Equal
I hate to brag, but damn I'm good!
And if mics were a gun, I'd be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, I'd be MVP:
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
And if rap was a school, I'd be the principal
Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill, that takes much practice
I got it good; apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern

Aw Yea, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics cause '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying?
And ain't no half stepping
Word, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date cause you are history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big—not little
So define it, here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane start to talk, cause

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
My field in court, then again on second thought
To have emcees coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best, oh yes, I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ah shit
I stop and stand strong over emcees
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know that

Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
""Down the road""

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losing? Pfft, picture that

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in, your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
The party people say, 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other emcees that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother emcee, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him

Hear ye, hear ye, from far and near
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
It's a story of a far-away atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So let's all gather around, because...

[Hmm...yeah...I'll take you there...oh!] (x4)

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime, they all'll say, [Hah?!]
They wouldn't even know what you mean
Cause it's a different program, y'all know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
There's a place that this can be done, and yo...

[Hmm...yeah...I'll take you there...oh!] (x4)

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
But! on the real tip, you will see
I'm not playing, what I'm saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems, no one says sorry
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa for instance, where there's starvation
But if you come with me, you're sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
[Is there WIC?]
Are you sick?
And what the hell is welfare?
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only $5.99
So come ye all and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land, and...

[Hmm...yeah...I'll take you there...oh!] (x3)

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]
Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny, but seriously folks
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
And we don't even need Scotty to beam us up
Because...

Funky!
Ready?
Funky! Funky! Ahhh...
One two, one two
We came here to do the motherfucking do
You and the crew
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Can't forget my man, Lik, y'all in the house
Got Fric and Frac in the house
Hey-hey-hey, you got Big Daddy Kane in the house
Juice Crew in the house
That's right
And my name is the Biz Markie
And we gonna rock a little something like this...

One, two, whatcha gonna do?
I say yes, yes y'all, to the beat, all
Party-having people guaranteed to be like having a ball
H-h-h-hey, we gonna do a little something like this I say...

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
I'm the rap promoter, I start to motor
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm odor
Put me on water, I'm a good floater
When I run for prez, you best be a voter
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watched Star Wars just to see Yoda
Or R2-D2 driving down the BQ
When I buy franks, I make sure they're Hebrew
When I entertain, and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nightie that's see-through
Take her to the crib, turn on the Beta
Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwarzenegger;
Maybe *Commando* or *The Terminator*
Peace party people, ha ha see you later
Big Daddy, huh huh, my man my mellow
Get on the mic cause you know you eat Jell-O

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
Check it out, y'all
You don't stop, keep on
Well it's the Kane in the flesh, of course I'm fresh
Oh you thought that I was rotten? Huh, I beg your pardon
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance...never!
Could I be weak, nah why I'm rather unique
I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique
That I be using and not many can manage
So a brother like me, I do damage
Just by picking up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out, and oh yo
I get physical, mystical, very artistical
Giving party people something funky to listen to
That's why the other MC's can't swing long
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
Stepping on roaches, I get ferocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Cause I'mma pimp, hear the primp, yes the emp-
Eror, bringing much terror in your era
I'm ready, willing and I'm able, so bust a move
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
Like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like thata-the-that, it's like that y'all
Cause I'm the prosecutor, taking a stand
And, I'm cross-examining you my man
The judge and jury, releasing my fury
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
You see, the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic, Nobody's Equal
I hate to brag, but damn I'm good
And if mics were a gun, I'd be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, I'd be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
Or if rap was a school, I'd be the principal
Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how it's properly done
Lights, camera, action
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, gigolo, Romeo

Tel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step

On the turntables to keep the crowd stable

Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes
Get wise to the exercise
Being taught by the teacher that's most dominant
You need knowledge?
Well I'm dropping it
Listen to the rap allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I?
[Yes you may!]
Proud to be a Black man
Coming exact and
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
[Marley Marl: yo, word to the mother!]
I say the mother, as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising
We be sizing
Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
And when I'm through speaking, Marley Marl'll do the rest

Take a stand the fight for power
Cause we've been here before the Mayflower
Living superior abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
The teacher, teaching a lesson to be heard
That's word, to the mother my brother
So discover the truth of one another
Cause here's the real deal upon our skin color
Lay down white, yellow, red or pink
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
[Marley Marl: what you going say now?]
Peace!

Let it rain, let it rain, to be put it pain
With nothin' to gain under the Wrath of Kane
Cause you can't maintain, I drained every brain
To leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
Or path or road, until the next episode
Let the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm
Or be funky like a underarm
And allow me to show how the microphone should flow
Now, competition bow, to me like a Buddha
The teacher, the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I ain't about that slouchin' or crabbin'
So save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin'
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm
Get loose, now put a boost and used to chill

I'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless
Cause you're useless, makin up excuses, excuses
So never touch, tap, tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper
Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But I'mma chill, won't even dispute you now
Actin wild just ain't my style
Cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
Quiet as kept, not like a star to you
But I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home
Steppin' to the man, now get the head flown
I bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow
Child you shouldn't even bother
To press up, and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
Just like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though
I'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow
And smooth to the groove with lyrics that soothe
And improve with every move, that's why you've
Been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football, and let's go the nine
Shorts I take none, cause I ain't the one
In '89 there's damage being done
And for you to diss me, will be very risky
Cause I make this be, as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose and fall
So y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign
Superior, cause I ain't even hearin' ya
Save the yang, cause it's a Big Daddy thang

Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome

I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society
So how we livin
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Givens?
Not to offend
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em)
Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover
Sellin' drugs to one another
Cause all the glamour you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, um, poison
Destruction to all your own boys and
Girls who like to buy and give it a try
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die
These are the games that a fool would play today

A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period)
Out of order, conquer and slaughter
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete

Because they can't drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day, I heard a brother say
""Taxi cabs don't even come my way
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop, the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money upfront
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged""
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)
Hey, even my man LL Cool J
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD
Public Enemy and (BDP)
Salt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever, never

Need to save it, and don't even play with

Or get played like a game of Nintendo

Looks like a job for King Asiatic

""Long Live the Kane,"" ain't a damn thing changed
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
We sample beats, you sue and try to fight us
*tchk* Maaaan, you still be home with arthritis!
If we didn't revive em, bring back alive
Old beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So understand, the way that I live
That's positive - and the message I got to give
It's a benefit for you and me
I'm talkin bout P.E.A.C.E
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
I got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef
No pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish
The Kane fallin victim? *tchk* Sucker, you wish
I flow like water, slaughter
Put you out of order.. floored ya!
Rappers are raggin and taggin and snaggin and braggin
To be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon
With the knack to attract the pack
So just GET BACK, I'm young, gifted and black

And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Sendin' this out to Divine Force
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
And to my good brothers EPMD
And to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast
Can't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two
I say, peace!",eastcoast

Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

[Verse 2]
Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

[Verse 3]
Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator

[Kane] Aiyyo whassup Red Alert? I'm chillin Duke
[Red] Yo do me a favor man -- pleeeeeease tell me
About these big ol bubblehead girls out here

[Big Daddy Kane]
Well hey, you know that lady on the top floor of my buildin?
The heavyset one with about ten children?
You may remember her as a slim honey
When her man name was Pimp Daddy Hustler Stack Money
A big time drug dealer from around the way
Slingin rocks, makin G's everyday
He drove a big fat Mercedes Benz
And even bought her a car to perpetrate for her friends
It was a brand new Jag, with the spoiler and rag
And the girl was a nag, cause all she did was just brag
I mean baaaaaaaaaaad -- we know your coat cost a lot
You didn't have to leave on the price tag
And count the times her stomach got plump
Havin baby after baby by the same old chump
And then the day came, he left the dame shamed
But who's to blame? Y'all know the name of the game
Pimp Daddy's wanted as he maxes and relaxes
She can't even sue for money, pushers don't pay taxes
So what's to do? Oh yeah
To feed ten mouths, she had to call on Mr. Welfare

[Red] What? Mr. Welfare?
Man they playin high-post with low income
Check this out -- when y'all go around to the corner
Y'all gonna check out another episode
Go like somethin like this..

[Big Daddy Kane]
Hey, if you think that suck, bust this
Another little story as I reminisce
About an old friend of mine that was livin out of order
Makin money like water (illlllll-egal?) Yeah, sorta
He sold drugs and robbed a lot of people
But in these days and times, who lives illegal?
It's all about who knows the trade
And who am I to knock him? Homeboy was gettin paid
He chose his own lifestyle to live - it was negative
But his own prerogative
Makin cash to flash and stash in half the trash
The cops made the dash (sufferin succotash!)
Because he had to do ten in the pen
And then begin again to apprehend, huh
But what's lost is lost, the reign is over
(Huhhh, see ya!) Nice to know ya
Money, no longer can he collect it
Can't even get a job cause he got a jail record
So what's left? No hopes of a career
So yeahhh, he's callin Mr. Welfare!

[Red] Mr. Big Daddy Kane
They don't know what time it is about Mr. Welfare
Do me a favor -- open up your book to page fifteen
At the top and read it off like thisssssssss

[Big Daddy Kane]
Here's a story of a guy who had to cop out his life
For bein a high school dropout
In the ninth grade he wanted to get paid
But now the young brother needs government aid
Because in his past he decided to cut class
And run in the streets to make ends meet
No shame in the game of his
But silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!
So when you sat on the corner with a 40 ounce
Talkin bout whattup? Can't even pronounce
Your words correct, now in retrospect
That's a shame - but in '89, who gives a heck?
There's no type of path to follow
It's all about a dollar, fuck bein a scholar
That's why your report card's through
Like a BizMark beat, it reads eww-eww-eww-eww-eww!
So now you wanna wake up and smell the coffee?
Lookin for a helpin hand, but get off me!
I tried to tell you the deal last summer
Stay in school, and get yourself a diploma
Now you're on your own, tryin to make it alone
No food or home, chewin on a meaty bone
So what's to do since the cupboard is bare?
Brrring brrring! Call on Mr. Welfare

[Red] Yo Kane, that's the story about my man Mr. Welfare huh?
[Kane] Yo like Chuck D said, how low can you go
[Red] If she go any lower, she gonna have a personal problem
Yo my man Mister Cee, cut it up money!

* Mister Cee cuts ""welll-fare"" *

[Kool DJ Red Alert]
We-eh-el-el-el, el-el-elllllllfare, c'mon!
Yeah Mr. Welfare
He on some new stuff, what what is it?
He all new and improved?
Right? Yeah, like that old Bug-Out stuff
This guy, is he alright or what?
I think he on a mission with no kind of learnin
You know what Big Daddy Kane?
We gonna have to take care of this matter
Mister Cee, go ahead, cut it up
My man Big Daddy Kane gonna see about my man Mr. Welfare alright?
Places to go, people to see, things to do
And you know what else to get.. see ya!

Can I see the peace sign up in the air?
You know what this is?
The wrath of Kane, takin over your circumfrence
Destroyin negativity, and suckers that come with
The weak, the wack, the words, they're poor
I thrash bash clash mash * Mister Cee scratch * and ten more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremer, see
You need a savior to save ya, so lean on me
I'm playin rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp em out like a watered roach
I slay my pray and they decay, I blow away and throw away
So go away, cause I don't play
Attackin like a psychopath; breakin rappers in half
So feel the wrath.. of Kane!

The man at hand, to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most, and boast the loudest rap
Kane'll reign your domain! (YEAH KANE!)
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, all the more higher
Level of def one step beyond dope
You suckers all scope and hope to cope but NOPE
Cause I can never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let us beat around the ball like an Astro
Then send em to jail for tryin to pass Go
Shakin em up, breakin em up, takin no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee let the volume grow
So I can flow, now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
And Doug E. Fresh, Stet', KRS and Public Enemy
Blase blah, you know who you are
The red black and green, the sun moon and star
Knowledge of Self, degree of twenty-one after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach and each
With the speech every leecher I'm impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb deaf and blind'll feel the wrath, of Kane!

Marley Marl break it down!

* fans screaming *

Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I got a rap ta
Those who chose to oppose, friend or foes I still dispose
Blow em out like afros
Too many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yellin and screamin and jeerin but still came out
Off the wall as butter soft-er y'all
So you waited for Kane, to come after all
Competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position, you on a mission
But stop lyin and tryin to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
Bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays, so you down in rhyme
I get busy from sun to sun
Only twenty-one, untouched by ANYONE
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes I keep em runnin like pantyhose
They got soft and tender, front and they'll surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on the trial, war be my style
But when I'm in effect, they feel the wrath, of Kane!

Alright, pump your fists in the air like this y'all
C'mon let me see the fists in the air
C'mon y'all
And let me hear you say yeahhhAHHHHahhhh, c'mon

[Kane] I ran into a young lady Maliya last night

Diamond link that you see me with on
[Riley] Mmm
[Kane] Smooth, you knowhatI'msayin? You know why?
[Riley] Why Kane?
[Kane] Cause I get the job done

[Hook x2]
""I work"" (x3)
""I work.. baby!""

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
The question at hand, is how do I love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because I love a young lady that's beautiful
But one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the Chinese cuts
But I'll take 'em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like Martin Luther King, I Shall Overcome
I get the job done

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushed into becoming some poohbutt's wife
And no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, I let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear, the Big Daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, ""Oooh I like it,"" just like DeBarge (how large)
Smooth and mild I'll make you smile, honey child
Then hit the lights and get buckwild
And when I turn her back on, you'll have to say
Like Calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, I'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..

[Hook]

T.R., take it to the bridge, uhh!

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]
Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm Brown-er than Bobby so won't you be my +Tenderoni+
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
An up-to-date mack that's ready to attack
And prove that I'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH
Girl, you won't disapprove
And I promise that you'll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like Tyson, a Captain like Kirk, no
Employee of the Month, cause yo, I do work
The K-A-N-E is on the J-O-B
An expert, cause I get it D-O-N-E
So lights, camera, action - all hail the one!
That gets the job done

Here we go, here we go on the smooth side
Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide
With the source, and of course
I don't wanna be the king or boss, I just wanna get my point across
'Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
Realize, we on the rise
To the climax, time to take charge
Whoever said we can't live large?
To seek out fortune without distortion
And stop livin' for just a small portion
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break
All chains become awake
Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave
And I ain't goin' out like a slave
In eighty-nine, I'm livin' like a champ
Step out my face, talkin' 'bout a food stamp
Child please, put it at ease
Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these
We can't take shorts or take a loss
So take it from the Kane and go for yours, because

[Verse 2]
There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear
We gotta step up front, to get our share
Make the change, cause we're not inferior
For example, there was a black Ms. America
Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
That if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemima
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
To stay alive, that's the reason I've
Came to, motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin' no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
Are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because

[Interlude]
Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go
One more thing

[Verse 3]
Let's unite together, we can't sever never
No matter what or whatever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I see equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
The true way of livin' that was really meant for us
So one more time, kick the chorus!

Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams
From my eyesight that was what it seemed
I said, uh, ""Come a little bit closer""
To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said ""Hi
Hi, hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?""
I said, ""Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate""
So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder
Went for Tootie 'cause the girl was much older
East to the Benz, I slowly walked
Clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
Sex in my mind, I was sure of it
I wanted to tax that ass like the government

When we went to see that picture
Iahhhhhh, I was the on the first thing smokin
Just to fly that head to getcha (I gotta getcha)
And what about the time that I called you long distance
On my car telephone (and I was alone)
Now that's what I call reachin out to touch somebody
At a million dollar zone
But you see, it didn't matter sweatheart, nah baby
Cause I'd call Mars for you
Climb the highest mountain to be by your side
Word to MOTHER, cause my love is true (my love is true)
Girl, if you could just understand (try to understand)
All the things that I'd do
Just for the sake of me, Kane, bein your man

*sung* How would it feel? To be your man? (2X)

Do it to em Blue Magic!

*sung* How would it feel? To be your man? (2X)

So whatchu sayin baby?

Can I be your man? (I'll be good to you)
So good to me..

Well, here we are
United just for you
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move

Verse 1 (Big Daddy Kane):

Na-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up
The slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up
Cause I don't let up or get up or even set up
On a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff
The Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff
Cause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'
Strong enough for a man but made for women
So come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky
It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
From the Cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely
Smooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me
And not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt
And after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt
Just to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G
You're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski
I'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me
I can fill up any girls that's empty
Give you somethin' that's mighy and strong
But ladies, don't get me wrong
Because you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya
And then catch amnesia
But the party people can't be denied
So I remember those who's on my side

(Repeat chorus)

Interlude 1:

Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scoob Lover, my brother.""

Verse 2 (Scoob Lover):

The mic goes around like a 40 ounce
Now, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce
I won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk
And, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk
Cause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother
For those who don't know me, I'm (who?) Scoob Lover
A jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow
For all the choice cuties, I'd love to say ""Hello""
So take away the 3, let's stick to 1, 2
Me and you, now here's a clue what we could do
It begins with an S and ends with an X
Hmmm, not the number 6, so guess what's next
So girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still
Cause it's about time for Scoob to get ill
Remeber you dissed, now you wanna kiss
Write me fan letters, sayin' that you miss
There's only one rap dance, the cool romancer
If I had a million dollars, I'd try to cure cancer
But I'm only here to get illey, ha
Now, I'm drug free and I don't smoke Phillies
So come here, shorty, go buy me a 40
And make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty

(Repeat chorus)

Interlude 2:

Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scrap Lover, my other.""

Verse 3 (Scrap Lover):

You get jacked if you ever try to nap
Ona a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps
Now, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off
You know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off
?Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say.?
You can't mislead me. Why? Cause I know the way
Always gave headahces, never known for heartaches
Time and effort, huh, that's what a star takes
Let me give you a true piece of mind
Cause this rare species is so hard to find
I'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts
Draggin' tattoes is what the girls found
Two on m chest, one draggin' on the ground
To all the young ladies that's clean and legit
As long as I got a face, you got a place o sit
No tokens for heart-broken turnstiles
No remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while
Those that's destined to question for a new thing
Join us in harmony together as we sing
For all the ladies determined that once was
So jealous, stop searchin' now cause....

Come, get some, you little bum
I take the cake but you can't get a crumb
From the poetic, authentic, superior
Ultimate, and all that good shit
I'm the original, Asiatic, acrobatic
There you have it, now get dramatic
Creatin' drama when I'm on the scene
And I pack 'em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial, a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble
And I'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin' hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
Your Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey
Starsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
That's for you not to come near, period
So I ain't buggin' or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a Fisher-Price MC
That thought he was nice into Minute Rice
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff
Cause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic I ravage, not like a savage
But in my own way of doin' damage
As I design the genuine line
Now who flattop rules in eighty-nine?

[Verse 2]
Take two other men with soul that you probably know
Deadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby show
Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush
They step to me, but can't stop the bum rush
I make material, rich and imperial
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Same old same old, but papa's got a brand new bag
So put the mic down boy, you can't work it
Due to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse
You lost, with force, of course, a holocaust
First I caught ya, then put ya through torture
You moved wrong my son, so I taught ya
Just like a guardian, that put your body in
The mood to groove with the smooth way that I'm partyin'
Competition may find it spectacular
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula
And waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here
So come near if you dare, you Booger Bear
You start hallucinatin' like magic
The wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it
Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'
Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin'
So pick a B.C. date, cause you're history
Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap, Jay, and Mister Cee
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
I'm the man you can't hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
I meant to say wack, a vision of blur
Just them thinkin' I'm competitin', I say, ""Huh!""

Or wannabe garbage?

I-i prefer to learn, cause this is for your own concern
You gotta-you gotta earn, however the world turns
So wake up-wake up, to put some sense in your head
Don't be-don't be mislead, use your brain instead
Because-because a brother like me, can't understand you
Playin yourself cheap, like a soggy old pamper

Since i'm-since I'm around, I'm destined and bound
To resurrect and perfect the entire school around
The whole-the whole entourage, a class so large
Under joe clark, ""i am the head [nigga] in charge!""
The man-the man with the master plan for discipline
Makin changes-makin changes, no matter what we twist or bend

Yeah..
You know, 1990 begins a new decade
Since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
It's been a three, four year stretch
And I'd just like to thank all of you
Mmm..
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States, overseas in the U.K
Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you

[Verse 1]
Here's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease, never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
'Cause I'm so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
I'll have you dancin' in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G
D-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place
Doin' the job how you want it done
With lyrics that's bright as the mornin' sun
So, grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine
And everythin' else'll combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh, also for every girly
To shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh, now, wait, now, wait, now, wait a minute
Uhh! Now, check this
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Not one, but all of the above
Comin' together like keys on a piano
Black and white to unite and oh man, oh man
What joy do we find?
Hard for me to say it sometimes

[Verse 2]
Nothin' can stop this flow so back up off me
Hold your cup of Folgers, wake up and smell the coffee
Big Daddy Kane’s the name of the one and only
You wanna say it three times like Tony! Toni! Toné!
It’s not an avocation of being the best
But I at least deserve a cape or an S on my chest
Quote: “The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice”
Mmm, they shoulda never turned me loose
'Cause I’m a true livin' Casanova
Smooth and stylistic and suave bowler
And they say nasty couldn’t even tell it
'Cause when I’m with girls, I get Funkadelic
So, ladies stand still as I start to fulfill
Just chill, the scenery’s about to get ill
The places I feel to give your body a thrill
As I rub you the right way like Johnny Gill
And competition take notes from a champ
You once had this but all your girls broke camp
And now you wanna diss
You swung but you missed
So, now, tip your hat and bow down to this
Who? The father of civilization
With knowledge of self under any situation
The F to the I to the V to the E
The P-E-R-C-E-N-T
That means an Asiatic king just rocked it
And left your mouth wet with a taste of chocolate
That’s right, y'all, and that’s right, y'all
My rhymes freshen the air like Lysol
Girls, uh, right there, yeah, right there

Move over bacon there's something meatier
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya
Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over
Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova
I'm not tryin' to say that I'm number one
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
So, let me lick you from head to toe
Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
In ummm... Kindergarten!!
Some played with Legos, some played with Play-Doh
But I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Lockin' up girls like I want
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em
I collect em like per diem and MMM, you gotta see em
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Verse 2]
Step up girls and get somethin' to treasure
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure
And if you're wondering if I want it --
I got a Craftmatic with your name written on it
I reminisce saying I take em eight to eighty
But I was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body
I just don't go to a Similac party
So all those of age, we can get intimate
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent
I treat girls just like pastry
Mmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky
A well known player, but not for the Yankees
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role
But I'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old
I'm taking love to a brand new height
And if loving girls is wrong I don't wanna be right
Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Verse 3]
If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack
That charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her
And bring about that feeling of passion
To have her on my body like modern day fashion
Layin' next to me, in pure ecstasy
You're like a door and you know that sex the key
So send your man to the lost and found
I'm bringing something that's world renowned
In other words - good lovin' that's major
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager
Running around saying, ""Please me, please me, please me""
That's why I say it ain't easy
But I've been able to maintain my status
With ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's
And other players just can't understand it
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded
I always end up with them on my shelf
*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself
You know why?

A presentation beyond compare
So MC's step to the rear as I break through
Girls say ooh and then skip to my loo
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Just like a passenger, hurry and fasten your seatbelt
Cause I'm about to start broadcastin
The words of wisdom, so turn up the system
Loud and clear, I don't want no one to miss one
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred
The preferred is absurd, all the damage that's occured
As I break MC's like a lumberjack
Ain't no comin back, you can't get none of that
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me
With the mic in my hand I start flowin then
All competition flee and start goin in
The other direction, run for protection
Cause I can burn an MC like an erection
You're too small kid, don't get involved with
The verbal law for the Nation of Islam
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod
Showin I got the power, and that's from bein born the God
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self
But they're just illiterate, so I don't consider it
Feedin off poison that's pollutin their mind
And that's the reason I don't swine
I gotta maintain, accelerate my brain
And god damn, it's hard being the Kane

Give it to me! C'mon!
C'mon! Uhh!
Give it to me! Give it here!
Give it to me! Yeah..

This is the proper way man should use ink
But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct
Just like a dinosaur, but you never find a more
Cause mine'll keep sellin on wax like some kind of whore
Let me inject this, flow of electric currency
For all the party people preferrin me
And spectatin like a tourist, cause you never
Saw this style of rap kickin like Chuck Norris
But this ain't Kung-Fu, no I just brung you
A style, that phony MC's were too young to
Digest, when I manifest, you adolescent
So sit back, relax, be glad you had a lesson
And this one's for your listenin pleasure
Somethin for all the bitin MC's to treasure
Just like a diary, for you to admire me
Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society
Cool as a draft, droppin math in a paragraph
I laugh as the wrath break in half, your whole staff
But many MC's were able to retreat
Runnin like an athlete, but I got bad feet
So I don't chase ya, nor do I wait to face ya
Nah it ain't in my nature
I just rip shop, flip-top, and watch MC's get dropped
As I manifest in hip-hop
Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck
And just like lightnin they struck
Down on all the toy MC's that annoy
That's how I build and destroy
The poetic printer, rough rhyme inventor
With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into
So I'm advisin competition to flee
Cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee
Holdin my own on the microphone
Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones
So let it rain let it rain as I put em in pain
God damn, it's hard bein the Kane!

Give it to me! Get up!
Come on! Uhh!
Give it to me! Come on!
Give it to me! Yeahhh

Put in a pause, because here's the holocaust
Above all laws, in effect and all yours
Cause I came to blaze a taste of bass of grace
A replace, erase the waste without a trace
My vocabulary will just have you very
Dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary --
That means competition
They can't even touch this, even with ammunition
Break out the gauge and go into an outrage
And I'mma still blow up the stage
Cause this is a death threat, but don't let your sweat get
In the way of your vision don't be missin when I get set
To go on a rampage, start a one man rage
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
And leave it in ruins from the damage that I'm doin
To prepare the atmosphere, as I put you in
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
And so..
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
To get fly and face the ace I put em in place
Proceed em, retreat em, defeat em, delete em, and feed em, and eat em
And all the rest of that good stuff, cause I don't need em
Only one survivor can remain
And god damn, it's got to be the Kane!

Get up! Give it to me!
Give it here! C'mon!
C'mon! Give it to me!

""I was born..""

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
A black man from the motherland
Speakin a language today most people don't understand
Where no one could bother me
'Cause I had freedom, justice, and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
And I was shipped to the U.S.A
A young brother made into a slave
To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Only adds up to being - deaf, dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?

""I was born..""

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
A native New Yorker on the streets
Known for rockin rhymes to real rough beats
That I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me a Hip-Hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top 20 or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin cock diesel
Saw a little cash and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
My whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
And say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
It's also the destruction of black people, so
Conjunction junction, what's your function?
Being a scout or sellin out?
Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye
And say: who am I?

[Verse 3: Gamilah Shabazz]
A solid change, have to rearrange this strange
Feelin I'm feelin, so appealin'
I am having to deal with
Time to forget the myth of bein black and a woman
Can't get ahead, walkin on a thread, a tightrope
Can't cope, don't be a dope, have a little bit of hope
Runnin' your scope on affairs
You have to be aware, don't flare up
Let your cup runneth over
I'm not Irish, don't need a donut to fill up my dish
Nor two mango wish to wish on a star, they're so far
Anyway I'm thinkin about today, not tomorrow
I'm not a follower of anyone
My time has come, it's already here
My message is clear
Like the women of long ago, I am also here
Also to show, I have the courage
Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity
No matter the life, length of time
Show me a sign, should I rely on a
Subliminal message, should I question
What would seem to be, life's told me?
Yes indeed, so let me speak

[Big Daddy Kane]
And that's comin from the daughter of Malcolm X
So black women put it in your texts
So you can never let, opportunity pass you by
Or even ask yourself, who am I?",eastcoast

C'mon.. * echoes *

[Verse 1]
Swing your partner, I'm about to start the
Dance across the land, the Kane will scar the
People of our community, cause we're soon to see
The future of the world to be without unity
So brothers and sisters, let's check our history
To reveal what's been hidden a mystery
Because we're headed for self-destruction
And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when
One black brother sells another one dope
And he can't cope, so he dies without hope
Many of us live on this level
Mislead victims who dance with the devil

[Hook]
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *

[Verse 2]
Guns are bein bought over the counter like candy
Comin in handy for chumps to act manly
Once before they were only for the law
But no more for sure, lookin at a L.A. gun war
Even in Brooklyn, lives are bein tooken
The Bronx is dyin while the rocks is steady cookin
Capsule after capsule, settin a trap to
Destroy all our kind without a hassle
I couldn't kill my brother, about a color
Or cocaine, not even over a rope chain
In this world I'm considered a rap rebel
To correct those who dance with the devil

[Hook]
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *

[Verse 3]
There's no survival
Bodies come in D.O.A, Dead On Arrival
Everytime someone ships in artillery
Begins the game wonderin who will the killer be
There's no war, so the Navy must wanna see
Drugs and guns shift into our country
So we can shoot each other and sell each other death
And imprison all the other ones left
So it's time to start to rise
We can't be uncivilized, we gotta realize
That bein the baddest doesn't matter when your life is had
So let Michael Jackson be _Bad_
No time to devestate, we gotta elevate
To a higher level.. than dancin with the devil

[Hook]
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil""

This is the dance with the devil!

""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *

[Verse 5]
Lookin at the fall of our new generation
Makes me wonder about the Emancipation Proclamation
We're considered to be free, but did slavery devour
When we're still slaves to mental death and power
Misled and unknowin, people are goin
More and more beneath, instead of growin
+Express Yourself+, was said by N.W.A
So stop givin trouble a play
Because those who chose to oppose never rose they all froze
At thirty-two degrees to enemies
That already tricked em and made em fall victim
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, just look at them
What we need is peace and love and more love
But I don't see none of the above
So one for the bass and two for the treble

Hey, you know, [Name]
I'm findin it very hard to understand
The lifestyle of young ladies today
{Male voice:}
Yo, they're hard to figure out, gee
They need a sincere leader

You know, I've heard it said
You gotta use what you got to get what you want
But I think they're usin a little bit too much when they flaunt
You know

I don't understand the way these girls is rolling today, man
How about you, man?

Yo, let me tell you somethin, gee
If they ain't lying they tryin to do some other - wildness

And can't even cook toast, right?
What I'm tryin to tell you, man, is...
They just ain't no damn good
No damn good

[Verse 1]
Now there's this girl named Monique
The type of female that you consider a freak
A big-time player playin like a drum beat
You think her address is 21 Hump Street
She step out every night to swing
With her Lee press-on's and a nefertiti ring
Bamboo earrings all big and lookin silly
With extensions hangin down like Milli Vanilli
And every Wednesday night at the Apollo
First kid she saw with jewerly she'd follow
And Monique would be ready to sleep
With the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep
Strung out and givin up the nappy dug out
You're on the critical list, about to pull the plug out
So here, nympho, here's some good info
Stop takin em putts and close your legs, toots
Cause I remember you was one of a kind and a fine - hm
I once was infatuated by the things that you do
But now you're doodoo
It's all about respectin yourself
In order to gain respect from anyone else
Treat yourself like a real woman should
Cause bitch, you ain't no damn good

That's right, there's a lotta young ladies out here
That just ain't no damn good
{Female voice:}
But hold up minute
There's a lotta guys out there that ain't no damn good either

Yeah, cause I had to tell one the other night
That his thing had too many 'nots' in it

What you mean by too many 'nots'?

Not big enough, not hard enough, and not long enough

Yeah, aight
But check this here out

[Verse 2]
Well now, here's another story
About this kid by the name of Corey
A hustler with game tryin to make a name
That was his aim, but his lifestyle was lame
Cause he would front like it wasn't even funny
About his girl, his car, and his money
Pullin out a knot every place
But every single bill had Washington's face
And he went beyond exaggeration
To lie about his means of transportation
Because he said he had a Benz car
Come to find out, it was his friend's car
Talk about simple chronic halitosis
Damn, his breath was ferocious
He had an odor that just won't quit
Smelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit
Tellin girls he's daddy long-strokin
(Shit, you must be jokin)
Cause he ain't got no bitches
And couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches
See, Corey, there's a lot you're missin
Seems to me, you ain't got a pot to piss in
So let's get one thing understood
Muthafucka, you ain't no damn good

You know B.W. I've heard it said
That a woman is a man's greatest gift

(Barry White)
Sure you're right

(Big Daddy Kane)
And success ain't nothin unless you have someone to share it with

(Barry White)
Mmmmm, so true, so true
I've always felt that it's great to achieve in life
Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is, uhh..

(Big Daddy Kane)
Sho' YOU'RE right

(Barry White)
Quite sad

(Big Daddy Kane)
In my case, I may have found someone (mmm)
I want, all, of that someone

(Barry White)
Yeah, I know what you mean
Well I'll tell you my friend
Just, communicate with her
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
Because, it's her that you want all of me

Make you want to give up that kind of commitment
Love is such a beautiful thing when it's, equally shared

When two people, find the same common ground
They call it, having, so much in common
Making love is one of things that people, these days
Seem to find too common (Communicate B.W)

Give it to me

Get on the dancefloor
Start to clap your hands for
The smooth operator, what more can your ask for
The musical maestro
That's usin the mic so
I can spark up the entire place like nitro-
Glycerine because the crowd is sizzlin
Bobbin they heads to what's said and still listenin
I specialize in fun
And I must know what's happenin cos you're dancin like re-run
So behold the natural born soul, a rhythm
To get em and hit em as I party with em
My job is to make you all feel this
But I'm not don cornelius
I'm just a new black cesar here to please ya, ease ya
Movin and groovin, provin, soothin at your leisure
I don't sing or yell
But my rhymes reach out and touch more people than Ma Bell
The brain of the Kane's so intelligent
You think dancin is irrelevant
And start stompin like a elephant
But that's not necessary, just let the beat carry
You into somethin funkadelic
That might best describe
The musical vibe you feel when I arrive
From the moment I walk through the door
I gotta keep em on the floor

Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(Let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(Give it here)
Get on up and dance
(Funky)

Look
You came in the disco
Thinkin it would be just low
But I'mma make sure you enjoy this show
You won't have a chance to sit down
(Get down)
And listen to rhymes that go the mile like a marathon
A voice that's choice, as strong as sarah vaugh
Swift delivery flowin like a river be
Flowin, but only ladies know my tongue is that slippery
I grab the mic and then we'll see
Who can d-a-n-c-e
Makin the crowd roar for more of what they saw
And I'm sure that I can keep em on the floor

{Chorus}

Oh
Feel like I'm down here by myself sometimes
I'm ready to break this groove down
You're ready

So I'mma let the music just stop
And we gon' get into our own thing for a minute here
You're ready

Break it down

Keep on dancin
(Keep on dancin)

(Dance)

Bring in paramedics to relieve the
Trace of this bad case of dance fever
Cos I can feel the disco heat gettin to me
While the sweat got my silk drawers stickin to me
But I can't stop, I gotta party
Like a gun on the dancefloor and catch a body
I might move real smooth
Then again dance real silly
Just like a hillbilly
As i make sure the beat is kept
So all the party people stay in step
Become a slave to the rhythm
Grab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em
Put your partner on the floor and face em
That shows a positive sign of unification
And if all party goers could make this move
We'd be one nation under a groove
So let's try this, stop the violence
That can only result in peace from what I sense
To be straight to the point
A little love and harmony - mh (it's the joint)
So build a nation, pump the bass and
The treble beyond the level of imagination
So the Big Daddy Kane can endure
And the name of this tune is Keep Em on the Floor

Intro: Mmm.. mmm, yeah
Oh I like this
I wanna tell this story
A little story about umm..
.. a brother who you would think has everything goin for himself
But apparently for some reason he just ain't happenin
I call this brother Mr. Pitiful
I wanna tell you somethin about him, check it out

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
The story begins in 1984
When I met the Biz Markie out in front of the store
He used to tell me all the time, ""Yo your lyrics is hype
We got to get together and make a record of some type""
I said, ""Man, the hype behind Run-D.M.C. and Cool J
What the fuck makes you think they're gonna give us a play?""
We did a few shows together, freestylin on stage
Manhattan and Long Island, for Mike and Dave
After that, I was convinced we can do it
Until my man Biz jetted and came out with ""Make the Music..""
From right there, I said, ""Man, this shit is real
Look at Biz in the new leather and a pair of spot bills""
I got to give it to you Dukes, I was wrong
Well you out there now, so put my black ass on
And sure enough, huh, in about a year's time
I was R-A-W, goin for mine
Droppin jams that slammed on every radio program
And bam, GOD DAMN, look where I am
The first album, _Long Live the Kane_, it sold
About umm.. AWW FUKKIT it went gold
The money was comin in, yes I had done em in
It wasn't quite hard for me to find a woman then
Cause I was in demand for lots of fans
A sexy chocolate guy in the public eye
I bought myself a condo out in Queens
A plush white Volvo and drove off the scene
But I remained the same since I moved out
For instance - drinkin Olde E and Guinness Stout
And also, hangin out with the troops
Most of all, takin care of Ma Dukes
Then all of a sudden things started to change
And many old friends started actin strange
Behind my back, sayin I'm soft and a sucker
Some even said, ""Yo let's rob the motherfucker""
And family members askin for my papers
But Biz set them straight, by makin ""The Vapors""
Girls cryin pregnant, to get some of my green
I'm like, ""What the fuck is this? Billie Jean?""
People harassin me, steadily askin me
Dis or dat, some even had the audacity
To say that I only liked light-skinned women
Tchk, huh, are you kiddin?
Cause I love everyone
And I never act prejudiced to none
But for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical
That's why they call me Mr. Pitiful

Outro: A few people know what I'm sayin
Hmm, to the Little Daddy Shane, you know what I mean
And to my man Cool V, you know what I mean
To T.J. Swan, you know what I mean
And to Scoob and Scrap, you know what I mean
To Rob Base and E.Z. Rock, you know what I mean
The Magnum Force, you know what I mean
And to the playboys, you know what I mean
To Shemp Shawn, you know what I mean
And the F.M.C., you know what I mean
Can't forget Miv, you know what I mean
Godfather D, you know what I mean
My man Doug E. Fresh, you know what I mean
And the fifty dollar crew from Canada know what I mean
But most of all I can't forget my man Biz-Mar-KIE

One for the ace and two for the deuce
If you're ready Mister Cee cut the record real loose
And uhh, test test test test, oh yes
I wanna bless the mic, I caress with finesse
Back off the microphone, you can't wreck it none
I'm like a nine, and you're just a Naked Gun
Some type of new jack, steppin in the area
Kind of reminds me of Eddie Murphy, Coming to America
But you can't approach this, rhymes are too ferocious
Do the knowledge as I quote this
Freddie Krueger, walkin on Kane's street
Five chapters and I still ain't been beat
Bout time I turned the microphone loose
Anyone after me is just an excuse
Even the level of the devil or Exorcist
Can't get next to this
This is mayhem, so competition, say when
You're thinkin that you're ready, so I can just play him
Or them, no matter the quan-tity, you don't want to be
In this battle, so just flee
Cause I leave em panickin when I start damagin
Kickin this swift, leaves you stiff, like a mannequin
And frozen, this is a mind explosion
As the chosen flows in, the competition throws in
The towel, my sharp tongue is like a license
I strike like Mike, Tyson I be icin
Breakin the mic in half, just like a psychopath
But still smooth and cool, just like a draft
Leave the metro scared and petrol
Ain't No Half-Steppin', so I don't sweat no MC
Cause Michael Jackson couldn't say it clearer
My only comp is the man in the mirror
So any pretender, you never been to
The death zone, this is the wrath, do not enter
These ain't the grounds for MC's to be wanderin
These is the grounds that the Kane is conquerin
Lyrics are bright and recite on the mic to excite
Delight, ignite, a bright light and a fright night
For types who bite, to be quite like
The man with mic swingin' all tight, but can't get it right
You're just a sloppy, cheap carbon copy
Sent to ride off in the sun, said Kemosabi
As the Kane remains everlasting
With lyrics that's fast relief like aspirin
So allow me to relieve, or breathe contact
Your brain and remain like hairweave
Cause I can reach each participant with a speech
That will teach, and have em hangin' like a leech
And yes still puttin rappers in fear
So hold it right there, cause this is a nightmare
As I cause a killer scene, and cut like a guillotine
Any thoughts you had about winnin is still a dream
Or more like a fantasy, tell me why can't you see
There ain't a way that you can touch or stand on me
You talk about how many rappers you slayed
But I'm like a renegade, so I never been afraid
So don't say hi to this Asiatic descendant
Just say peace and everything'll be splendid
Peace!

Mister Cee, put your weight on it
Boy put your weight on it, put your weight on it
Put your weight on it
Put your weight on it Mister Cee, put your weight on it!

Well Dolemite is my name
And rappin and tappin is my game

[Kane]
Oh yeah? Well me tell you somethin Mr. Dolemite
The shit you talkin years ago, I could see
But it's the 90's now and rap is all about me

[Dolemite]
Listen.. when it comes down to rappin
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm the KING so I'm stakin my claim
In the rappin game
Y'know? For all players, I am the speaker
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin down Broadway the other day
An old old lady came my way
She said, ""I'll be glad when you 'come 18
I'm gonna give you a funkin like you ain't never seen!""
I said, ""LADY! Why wait for so much time to pass?
I've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass""
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The ho took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
That, ""Oh Mr. Dolemite, take that motherfucker OUT!""

[Kane]
Well you ain't sayin nothin slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean til that shit was dry
I was makin money before Washington was put on a bill
And I kicked Jack's ass and took his ho Jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
And made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac

[Dolemite]
Why you long lanky motherfucker
You ain't nothin but a sucker!
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two Colt .45's
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Handcuff lightning and throw THUNDER's ass in jail

[Kane]
Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
Let me tell you somethin
I'm the one that put the M in mackin
Because when you did it you was only actin
I made pimpin a full time job
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA
And hung a Home Sweet Ho sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks
Give a headache to Excedrin and knock the SHIT out of Ex-Lax

[Dolemite]
Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
Rat soup eatin motherfucker!!
It was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin game
I was callin whores jives ass bitches
And pimps - sucker ass lame
KANE, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the POCKS in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR
And get out and do the runnin man while you up there
Have the Mumps and the Asiastic Flu
And the Crabs around yo' ass start singin the Yankee Doodle Doo!

Aiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine
But I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when
A toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and
There's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after
Is smashed, for that reason you have to
Make sure each and every lyric is harmless
Cause if not, you won't be able to calm this
Brother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove
And prepared for the unexpected, to make a move
So put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop
And if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop
The capital S the C, the R-A-P
Stands for me, cause I'm the
Only MC with an original rap style
You disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile
So stay off the set, with George and Jet-son
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Co-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit
Or get ate like oats and barley
Save your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie
So next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover

[Scoob Lover]
Yo, the microphone's mine
It's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all
Well god damn it's me y'all
Jump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly
Sip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high
I might wave hi..
.. at a pretty young girl that walk by
But yo, you all that, you can't stop?
A-with the weave in your head like a mop?
You must know karate, cause your face look chopped
Now back to the subject of the matter
I eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter
Let me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed
And when I'm low-key I throw on a brim
But I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin
What are you, smokin?
You be hopin wishin and prayin
To be like Scoob but what are you sayin?
Well it takes style, charisma, class
Fuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass
So next up, movin down the line
Mister Cee

[Mister Cee]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Mission, to make DJ's feel the wrath
So here's a paragraph, written on behalf
Of the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador
Makin a massacre, you couldn't last through a
Round of combat, where my left arm's at
My mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack
I shake and bake or fake a snake
Take em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake
When I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt
I'mma tear shit up
So next up goin down the line
The Little Daddy Shane

[Little Daddy Shane]
The mic is all mine
MC's crawl by when they see this tall guy
Six foot three huh, nobody's small fry
The Little D-A double-D Y
The S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains
I'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke
One false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!
So take it easy and slide on greasy
Cause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep that in mind, mon cherie amore
Cause I'm a lover you find quite young
And Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from
So keep it on and you don't quit
That supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit
So next up down the line, Ant Live

[Ant Live]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Yeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back
And it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack
Got the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place
Not Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface
But I know, if some shit goes down
I'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown
A 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
All I need is my loaded four-five
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene Park and survive...
And my name is Ant Live!

[Big Daddy Kane]
Now that's what I'm talkin bout
That's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs

That means the United States, overseas in the U.K
Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else

Here's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease is never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
Cause I'm so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
I'll have you dancin' in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G
D-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place
Doin' the job how you want it done
With lyrics that's bright as the morning sun
So grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine
And everything else'll combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh, also for every girlie
To shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh, now wait, now wait, now wait a minute
Uhh! Now check this

I get down for my crown with new found wreck
And bring the noise like I'm comin to soundcheck
The stage is clear for me to rock it
So I snatch the mic like a Brooklyn nigga does a pocket
Clear the throat, to perform the art
To treat the stage like a movie ticket and rip it apart
Watch the crowd burst from lyrics that I say
To make the brothers get ill, and by the way Dukes
If that's your girl in the corner stay up on her
Cause I've been watchin her more, then a Korean store owner
(Whoo!) Mack man number one, you know how I move
You'd think that I'd be shavin my rhymes, cause they'd be so smooth
Mr. Wonderful and all of that gun to pull shit

The kid got, to get hot, you thought that I would flip-flop
Or drop-drop, but ummmmmmmmmmmm.. I did not!
They say, ""Kane you're old school out here!""
I said, ""I guess I got left back, cause I ain't goin nowhere""
The Kane will remain in this domain
To reign again when I entertain
Cause when it comes to lyrics, I got plenty black
I'm so god damn dope, I sell rhymes in a twenty sack

I kicks the flavor good, to represent the neighborhood
Where I come from, and that's the place of Brooklyn
Where the grimies are born and bred
And bullets are like eyeballs, two to the head

[Scoob]
Well is it Brownsville? Time to represent for the map
Where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
From the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code

[Big Daddy Kane]
Parlayin on the corner, drinkin 40's shootin cee-lo
It's a Brooklyn thing, aight? You know our steelo
And for those who just don't know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know

So yo, who wanna set it? You better kick your best G
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me
I represent for the fo' main
And if you're not a booty bandit, then niggas can't hang

Chorus

[Big Daddy Kane]
Now, let's get straight down to the point
I represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin it to
Makin a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget
Where you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not
And front with what you got
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
What type of mission can I say you on?
Because you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh
I'm really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
In the PJ's all your life, in a broken home
(Scoob: Well alright now)
Up in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT!
I be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover
Bonafied black brother, word to the mother
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
The man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
In ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted
Funk'll slam like a doper jam, pops
I'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam
So check out the asiatic type of flow
Like water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style

Chorus

[Scoob]
Yo, this is Big Scoob, no practice
I'm flippin on niggas like little kids on that mattress
You know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's
My lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's
So hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin
My boys in the back, clockin your jewels, and they scheamin
Why did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
No need for beef chief I'm rollin mad deep
So pick up your teeth, I got him shakin like a leaf
Not tryin to scare you, I just wanna aware you
I bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you
Yo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these
While you're guardin your grill, I'll be beatin up your kidneys
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9's
With my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines
Where I'm from there's no need for hesitation
We cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient?
He's drippin blood and now he's down to his last breath
But he won't make it, cause he knows that my joint is def
The ill, type of Brooklyn artist
Who rocks the har-dest, regard-less
Who you know and where you're from I pull your file

The others gotta try to survive, doin the evil
That men do, peace to every hood that I been through
I even got love for my homies in South Central
But to the East my brother, cause that's where I stay at
Runnin through the streets like a stray cat
Like that Good Times show it makes me go
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Up in the projects, it gets no ILLER
With true gue-RILLAS, and stone cold KILLERS
It seems that every night, you get to hear the fireworks
As much as I hate, to see my people die or hurt
It's just a street mentality, a reality
Neighborhood warfare, that brings home casualties
And just because I moved out the residence
It don't mean that I can't represent

Are we gonna shoot some cee-lo, or play a game of craps?
Matter fact, Shane, ring the intercom
And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare
Cause the elevator's broke, and I ain't checkin for the stairs
And do me a solid, run to the store shorty
And pick me up some Olde E, but not a 40
Just a two-two of brew will do, so I can knock it out fast
To make the coldness last

Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
NBA style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight
I write left-handed cause I like to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
If I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Sucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear

And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killing
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
Now tell me who is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That'll dethrone ya, scorn ya, joan ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none

I see the way you're trying to get to me
But with that speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with

Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""Ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head

Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says ""Go ask your goddamn father!""
It's all about me in the place to be

Do you know, what you're goin through?
Do you like this style of rap that I'm showin you?
The way I flow for you.. do you know?

[Intro: rapped]
Yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song
Uhh, aw yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song

One double nine to the four, gotta keep 'em on the floor
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What I'm used to hearin', I can't believe it's gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices weak in the knees
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills, come see how it feels
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin'
If my rhymes was in Braille, you still couldn't touch em
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that
Rappers today be comin' as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right
Here's the news, you lettin' the word hardcore be misused
You ain't never paid dues
Be for real, you ain't tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin' you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmn sham
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
That battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die -- choose one!
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin' sex, the way that I put it in 'em
And do I crush MCs? are you kiddin me?
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I blow
A rapper off the map, with the rap, when I flow
Then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I know
That all of this is good to go, 'cause yo
That's the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin' to the drum
The Brooklyn style cause that is where I'm from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that
Amazin' the people the style of the rappin', is quite fat
I'm lickin' the lyrics and shootin' the gat, on the mic, black
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin' the tone that make the girls relax and moan
'Cause all the ladies I'm givin' 'em lots of love
Hittin' more skins than a boxing glove, good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmy ones
Watch out Goldie! Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
With skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than
Taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
'Cause Kane is makin' a comeback, like Pumas
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company
And Bogart, like my name was Humphrey
When I get through, there'll be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium
I make mad MC's give me my P's
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these
N.U.T.s, like the U.N.V.s
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-hees!
Razor sharp, many ways of art
Source rings the chart, people praise the God
For kickin' the flows so fantastic and this one here
We're callin' it Lyrical Gymnastics

Uhh, so baby baby c'mon
Aw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song
Uhh, ah baby baby c'mon
Suki suki c'mon, and I'm gone!",eastcoast

No Daddy, tell them how you beat down that bootlegger
Daddy Daddy tell us a story!

[Big Daddy Kane]
Heh heh, alright, alright, alright y'all OK
Come on y'all, crowd around Daddy now OK? C'mon
Y'all just sit there and listen
I'mma tell you about the MC
And I'mma tell you about the bootlegger, OK?
Here we go children

[Verse 1]
It happened at a jam, some kid tried to sham on the program
So I had to silence the lamb and show him who I am
So I just set it off on my competitor
Freakin the funk as I hit em with crazy metaphors
Like back up off me Dukes, because you're trippin
You better dry your cranium off, cause your brain is slippin
You beatin me is somethin that I doubt
The only way you could bake Kane is workin in a crackhouse
No man alive can withstand the Kane flow
I kick so much flavor that my shoes look like a rainbow
You need a whole lot of practice, you thought that you was
On the money so I took you out like taxes!
Now you can Flea Off, releasin me G, easy be
To keep the great MC
Then I throw em I lean and mean record to spark
So I can school that ass just like Joe Clark
Next I translated, my rap is more educated
And made it complicated for him to illustrate it
My dexterity, put him in fear of me
And had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin see
That was enough to slow his whole train of thought down
So I just speeded the pace up more than enough for him to come around
I triple the words, when makin the rhymes, whatever the rhythm
Puttin his mind in a prison
And oh yeah, that's how I did em

That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HEYYYYYYYY)

[Verse 2]
I was out flex, lookin cold sex in a Lex'
Sippin on a Beck's, pumpin the remix of Das EFX
Drive down 125th with my man
And what did I see, bein sold at the stand?
A bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it
So I snatched everything with my name on it
And give me that Kool G. Rap tape, and give me that Ice Cube
And all the Wu-Tang joints, cause they're my boys too
A man tryin to make a livin, I can't knock it
But now you tried to take money out of my pocket
Word to Miz, what the problem is, is that the kids
Didn't buy it from The Wiz, they bought your shaky fibs so
Now it's time to move him off the block
Pass me the Glock cause I might make a body rock
And I'll break down sixteen shots
That's One + Eight + Seven on a undercover
Bootlegger, you're worse than a beggar
Makin a fake profit, stop it
Cause I work hard for the money, to make cash flow
To have another come along and take my dough
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
So I just told my man, aiyyo
Throw the tapes in the Lexus
Then we burned his whole stand down just like Waco, Texas
And then I jumped on the brother, with rage
Crushed his ribcage, damn did he get slayed
Cause I don't think he even know whatever hit him
Bootleggers beware, cause yeah I did em

That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HEYYYYYYYY)

[Verse 3]
Give it your best shot, bring it with all you got
And watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot
Cause it ain't wise to address me
I wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me
Cause I don't just do em, I run through em
And I don't just hurt, uh uh, I body work em
Lyrical torture, never could support ya
For steppin to me, agony is what it brought ya
Cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
That could never be touched, and I mean this
So one love, I'mma leave you with the rhythm
Ain't no need to go off, cause yo hon know I did em

That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)
That's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)

The definition of sex varies with many people
In search of a few ways to define it
We asked actor/comedian Mr. Dolemite his definition of sex
And his response was..

[Dolemite]
Baby, sex is just like puttin money in the bank
Once you take it out, the interest is all gone

[Female reporter]
Then we asked rap star Big Daddy Kane his definition of sex
And well [clears throat] according to the Prince of Darkness..

[Big Daddy Kane]
Here comes Kane the mack, the sex maniac
Bring on the honeys and you can't restrain me back from ff...
Nah I better not say the whole word
So uhh, let's just say we'll make Whoopi like Goldberg
Cause I wanna make you sweat, get you wet
Perform a miracle in this love duet, see baby
I play the game like Keno, plus I know the
Scent of a Woman better than Al Pacino
And when it comes to girls, I show no mercy
They lick me on the chest and say, 'To hell with Hershey'
Now it's time for me to lick that body
And this is no Ordinary Love, ask Sade
Baby you're bound to perspire, when I use
The nipples on your breasts just like a pacifier
Honey please, keep your body at ease
And let me see what I can do with those 34 C's
I plan to lick your bellybutton my dear
And let my tongue walk five steps downstairs
The way that I plan to put this chocolate syrup to use
I'm gonna wake up in the mornin with a hairy sweettooth
And now you're under my spell like a magician
Abra-cadabra, good sex and I have ya
Laid out, waitin for a big treat
I'm not the Ku Klux Klan but I stay under sheets
And when it comes to sex, yo I'm the illest
Plus I know more Diff'rent Strokes than Arnold and Willis
I make you feel the reel to reel you feel
When I break the headboard down like Shaquille
Then bend over doggy style and just watch me
Ride yo' black ass like I was still filmin Posse
Then I'm the one that gets the job done
My mattress have more bodies than Al Capone's, gun
When I get through givin you mine, uhh
Girls be callin me back like star-69
So come on over here hottie, let me just
'work that body, work that body'

Uh-huh, uh-huh..
Straight like that..

Hurt me, baby (that's right)
That-that-that funk
That-that-that-that-
That-that's-that's funkdafied-like fonk
That's that retarded-like fonk
Like you put your armpits in the drum machine
Good God
Break me off some of that
Come on

[Verse 1]
Easy Mo, just let the beat rock
From your sweet stock
To bounce the complete block
Make everyone, on the street flock
To this here rhythm
Music'll hit 'em, get 'em
My lyrics'll fit 'em, when I get with 'em
They'll admit I'm, smokin' like bags of ism
The way that I keep amazin'
Y'all don't even know who you're facin', pa
The Kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car
The one who created it and many others imitated it
I heard your rap style, kid - I hated it
Let me show you how, look here, now check my style
What I spit out, it'll raise your brow, make you say ""wow""
Ba-da-bow-bow, come on, now let's get down
And sway this way when you hear the music play
Hip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say
Hey

[Bridge]
I'm in love with Big Daddy Kane
He makes the party swing
He turns the mother out
And rips apart things

Then I go...

[Hook]
Da-da-da-daaa-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin' down
Da-da-da-daaa-da
You know I like the way it sound
And I just love the way it's goin' down

[Verse 2]
Now, what's this BS you're sayin'?
And don't try to act like Martin now, with all that 'I was just playin'
No need to grief or mourn, cause now The Beef is On
Boom-bap boo-bow-bow - kid, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap, that don't mean that ya catchin' wreck with me
You step to this, I give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one person that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle
Cause, I can't count my own shadow
A battle? I gots to have it
Unless you're gonna rob me like they did Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause tryin' to go against the Kane rappin'
Is like a pimp tryna pull a nun - ain't nothin' happenin'
Clear the way for the one, champ-ion, true black don
Who begun gettin' the job done, take a look, hon
Back up, son, you know you can't get none
Come on, I'm on a whole 'nother level of rap
And it's like that, now show me where the party at
Uh huh

The B-I-G D-A-D Y, no, back up and add another D
Then back to the K to the A to the N to the E
Live from New York, the one and only
I give it to you raw for my homies
Uh, and to the ladies: I take em lookin' somethin' fine
And don't mind if we bump 'n grind
If you're with me, jump in line
Because, if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic
Then you better believe girl, that you gonna get your ass dicked
Hard type of rappers extinct, like a dinosaur
The kind you saw the rhyme before
But now you never find no more
Steppin' to the Kane with some drama to be startin'
Because I put 'em all on ice, like Tonya Harding
Back up, boy, I got the whole convoy
Rollin' with me on a mission, that's to seek and destroy
So, to all the people that's been tryin' to talk about me
You better change your name to 5000, cause you're Audi
And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin' to them too
Just put the beat on and watch how I swim through
The groove, with more style than a backstroke
Drivin' past my competition, like cab drivers do black folks
That's the way I move, I always stayed the Smooth
Operator with data watin' for you to play a groove
To turn it out without a doubt, and show what I'm about
Good lookin, Brooklyn, yeah, we in the house
Sham on

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a family man that works hard for the money
With the sweetest wife ever, I love you honey
I buy her everything, if it takes my last dollar
Even her nails and her hair to be done at the beauty parlor
We spend ample time together, doin' dinner and a movie
And whatever else sounds groovy
And when we want real excitement and drama
Word to momma, w walk around in our pajamas in the Bahamas
I love her and I need her and I never ever cheat her
I'm far too caring to be considered a woman beater
My style is gentle, romantic and friendly
Nothin' like the husband from ""Sleeping With the Enemy""
I thought that she was in love with me
I used to think that she couldn't get enough of me
But lately things been seemin' strange
And you've changed

[Hook]
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed

[Verse 2]
Now I've heard of traffic but I've never heard of when
You get off at five and don't make it home til ten
Another thing that I can't comprehend
Matchbox and pens from the Holiday Inn
And every night that I had to work late
I come home to see that the bathroom ain't straight
I look at the toilet bowl and wonder whassup
Because I know damn well that she don't piss with the seat up
And lookin' at the underwear in the room
Now I wear silk drawers, whose Fruit of the Looms?
Another thing that's quite bizarre
My bathrobe smelled like Brut, but I use Drakkar
Now I'm seein' that she's treatin' me crummy
Also, she must take me for some dummy
Because she'll lay in bed and say, ""Come on in""
But them ain't the same bed sheets from this morning
Now yeah my dear have you been busted
But I still feel like P.E., ""Can't Truss It""
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head
And you might get that, you cheesy rat
Cause thinkin' about the cost of a divorce
I feel like Johnnie Taylor, it's cheaper to keep her
Cheatin' on me, what's the reason why?
I hope you die

[Hook]
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed

[Interlude]
You done hurt me, broke my heart
And played me for your fool
Now here's my chance to get back at you
And I'm gonna blow my cool

[Verse 3]
All day long
I'm just singin' a somebody done somebody wrong song
I'm tryin' to see how far can this kid go
Before our relationship ends up on skid row
Why should I try to stay attached to her
When I'm probably better anywhere as a bachelor
So go 'head girl with that game you're talkin'
And since you look like CeCe Peniston, ""Keep On Walkin'""
Your your your cheatin' heart, you're tryin' to rip mine apart
Ugh, I wish I'd seen it from the start
Cause now you're caught in what you thought was a fort
Took a short, so I'll see you in court

[Hook]
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed

People people, we gotta get over
Before we go under, and I wonder
Why we can't find a little piece of mankind
Instead of always step back, gimme my damn nine
Livin the thug, like the shoot up the drug type
They love to hear the people sayin, ""Yo that kid is bugged right?""
Just a game, so please, out here men die
The average black man today don't make it to see twenty-five
Cause someone else got the clock rocked
Tryin to get the neighborhood locked, to be the new man on the block
But if you asked me who's the man I'm like, ""You tell me?
I don't know, Ed Lover, Dr. Dre and Heavy D?""
I got my mind on comin up, if not in first place
Then damnit I plan to be the first runner up
But it seems, I got a lot of problems under my belt
And everday I gotta ask myself

Fifteen years old, with plenty drugs bein sold
But then somebody caught him for his Air Jordans
His drugs the cash and the jewels he was sportin
You wanna call your girl a B-I-T-C-H
You can't appreciate so now she's humpin your man, then she ain't
Cause when you teach her that ho mentality
They accept that as reality and give all your friends the skin
You need to show some love for your people
All men are created equal, that's why with everybody I always
Spread love, and keep my pockets full of dol-dollars
But check it out now
We're not the uncivilized, the Kane?
So let's get it together, man we did it when we were slaves
Instead of always tryin to blame someone else
Take a look around, and ask yourself

Nowadays it's all about provin you ain't nuttin soft
And everybody's always talkin about bustin off
But that ain't where we gotta go, kid we can throw
And handle this thing like Holyfield and blow
Then when we get it off our chest, let's put it to rest
And try to make some money progress
Because if I got a dollar, and you got ten
And you can get a hundred from a friend if five others kick in
Shoot, we can take that stack and put it back
In a community that's black, to make our people attract
Like somethin magnetic, cause word is bond it's pathetic
We always talkin about this piece of the pie
But it seems we can't get it
Unless we field the life of a drug dealer
And start stellin llello but you know where they go
Up to the penile, because they chose to be wild
And now you're upstate kid, uh, waitin patiently to see trial
Now let that whole gangsta route slide
There's too much money and skins here on the outside
For me to ever let my freedom go
Cause I got mine, now get yous, and let me know

Somebody tell me who's that, what's that
It's the man with the silk drawers stuck up his buttcrack
Don't even front and try to ask who is this
Cause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah Witness
Stronger than Listerine, moppin up rappers like Mr. Clean
Oh Lord, the Kane just hit the scene
Booyaka bo buck, rappers have no luck
Cause when I come through, I'm catchin wreck, like a tow truck
Cause ain't no way in the world the Kane could ever, fade
I'm stayin on top of this thing, in order for me to get, paid
And anyone comin to me for a battle is gettin, slayed
Whenever it comes to the lyrics I'm rappin I got it, made
So back up off me, cause yo' rap
Have no hap' so slow dat and act like you know dat
Cause you can dream about bein this up to par
But not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are
Competition I'll drill em, and definitely outskill em
To make the long story short, I kill em
Cause I face em like Jason, bizarre
And when I come through, it's like tchk tchk ahh

Come on, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Come on, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Come on, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!

[Verse 2]
Givin you mo', ready to go, kickin the flow, rippin the show
Comin to blow, check out a pro, look at the glow, act like you know
Left the lonely lonely through lyrics loose in me
Leave the lowlife left lingerin lost like ???
Anything you can imagine done to a microphone I did it
Ripped it, flipped it, hit it, split it, let it so dig it
But don't make me get ill, or chill, cause if I exercise my skill
Rappers'll hit the floor like Johnny Gill
The smoothest soloist, with this to exist to bliss
And diss who risk to test this
Cause this ain't no game, I treat you like
A picture of my ex-girl, and rip that ass out the frame
I come pursuant, pursuant, pursuant, pursuant
And step it to him, to him, to him, to him, to him
I leave a rapper's career ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined
And watch him fade like my voice is doin, doin, doin
Ease back when I attack
Your poetry is wack so don't ask for no slack
Cause I'm tell you straight up, I'mma bring it son
You want +Poetic Justice+ go see John Singleton
Because a battle ain't no thing to me
And I don't look nothin like Tarzan
So don't think you can swing with me
Just let the Kane take control, I'd like to know
If you really ready for some super dynamite soul!

[Chorus]
Then come on, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Uh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Uh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Come on, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!

[Verse 3]
So what's this? A new attitude, you're tryin to act rude
You saw _Menace_ and now you in a gangsta mood
What are you kiddin me? That's the heart of stupidity
If you wanna be a gangsta, join the mafia in Italy
Fakin and frontin on stage like you're hard
I hope when you get to Detroit, the real thugs gon' pull your card
Flashin guns like you got somethin to prove G
What, you wanna be in the next John Singleton movie?
You're sayin that you're buckwhylin
But don't convince me, convince the brothers on the Island
Otherwise just forget it, unless niggas that did ten years
Say you a gangsta, I ain't wit it
""Yo, I raped his mother, yo, I shot and killed him""
Is that what you wanna get across to the children?
I guess you're not gonna be happy til it's for real
Four year old kids, doin drivebys on Big Wheels
Or maybe you wanna see it be more fatal
Like Kindergarten kids, tryin to cook crack with Play-Doh
Now I don't mean to take the fun out the jam
I just want some to understand about the gun in the hand
We gotta show our people how to live equal
Peace out, I'm catchin folks on the sequel

[Chorus]
It go, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow
So let yourself go!
Uh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho
And yo I got the funky flow

Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, Kane, drop it like it's hot
Yo, pick up the microphone and gimme what you got
{Big Daddy Kane:}
Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, Scoob, drop it like it's hot
Pick up your microphone, it's time to rock the spot

(x2)

(Oh my god, tell me, is it really him?
The legendary lyricist makin matters grim?)
Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly
Rappers start shakin like the legs on Elvis Presley
Sayin (It's him, the great) that's how I intimidate
But I just came to get my shit off, so I give them a break
And pickin up the microphone after I left
Is like givin mouth-to-mouth to a corpse, a waste of breath
In other words, I don't leave no remains for you
(Forget the men, that's the evil that Kane'll do)
I bring it raw, gee, too hardcore, gee
The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy
The magnificient, none can come swifter than
Cool as ???, but my skin color is different
We got the milk and honey
My rhymes are just like Abraham Lincoln's face (on the money)
Makin me freshest on the land, but let's not forget
That if I rapped under water they'd be Aquafresh
The best, oh yes, I guess... (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
- You said that shit in '88)
Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate
And regulate chumps and set em straight
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours
The source to the force, so put it on pause
The one that assures applause, never took a loss
Stronger than some Olde E quarts to a can of Coors
In other words it's hazardous to your health
So don't do it to yourself

[Hook:]
Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not

(x2)

(Stop right there, you better freeze, cease
Don't make me put my Timberland boot to your grill piece
Big Scoob from Brooklyn comin through, don't start me
Don't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party)
Hey yo, what in the world would ever possess you
To think that you could touch me
Or even try to come above me
Or even think that you could flow this lovely?
Nobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it
I rip it apart, and flip up the art cause I'm the best, damn it
I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me
(Step to the Kane) and get bagged just like grocery
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em
With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel
And I got hemorrhoids from shittin on so many people
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)
The Chocolate City for Black Cesar Incorporated
(And all of the soft get faded)
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than Special Ed
Cause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin against anyone else
I'm tellin you, don't do it to yourself
