I don't gossip like bitches I mind my own fuckin business
Dig yaper good money cause that sucker shit ain't nutritious

Smack it up, flip it, rub it down
Feels so good when you go downtown
I like it when you moan and groan and make that sound
I love to see your face when you do that frown
Don't hold back just do yo' job
Lick it up and down like corn on the cob
Slob on my knob while your pussy throb
Gimme head 'til I'm deader than a fuckin do'knob
Theraputic and healin, couldn't fight the feelin
She pulled my dick back like a banana peelin
Her throat game platinum, worth a million
Put her on the track, we can make a killin
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose
Low cut jeans, like to show that flesh
Pierced toungue ring, big lips and breasts
Ecstasy... Hennessy... broccoli... the remedy
Late night creepin at the Embassy
On hard like I'm out the penitentiary
Baby got back like a slab of ribs
Dang near wanna make her have my kids
Take her home, let her meet my mom and dad
Then introduce her to all my nigs
Front back, side to side
Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again
Have a deep throat contest, you and your friends
Like the 4th of July I'm tryin to reach my peak
Pull it out your mouth, now it's time to skeet
Shoot it everywhere while I'm beatin my meat
In your face, in your hair, all over the sheets

Slow, want head, that's the type of shit I'm talkin 'bout
Gimme that, gimme that, I'm so glad you into that
If chewing's what your doin, then you best believe I'm comin' back
Black, white, asian, and latino, don't discriminate
Take it out, take it to the face, then ejaculate
Freaky bitch, nasty bitch, my nig' I swear she love this shit
Don't trip pimpin', she gon' swallow it if you bust in it
Look into her eyes, she gon' cum, in the process
Have her panties soakin wet, try to make her choke on it
Deep throat action, hard dick is what I'm packin
When she coughin, when she gaggin, she get pimp, satisfaction
... Got a nigga weak in the knees-ah
Speakin in another toungue, thank you mamacita
That's the way you freak her, pupita in her beaker

Been down for ten months and got a eight-year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry
Mayne, ya out there ballin', mayne, can you drop a twamp up in my commissary?
Uhh, my family thinks that I'm a thug, homie
When you see my momma, man, give her a hug for me
And tell her

[Chorus: E-40 + Levitti + (Geraldine Michaels)]
One love (One love) One love
Ohhhh (One love)
One love (One love) One love

Ohhhh (One love)
One love (One love) One love
Well wellll (There's only one love)

[Verse 3: E-40]
Huh, thinkin' back, you gotta watch your back and play it well
Enjoyed myself when I was out there tryin' to get in that mail
We used to kick it at the Waterfront, the whole Vallejo
Watchin' the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge, fools posted up
Choppin' game, conversatin', gettin' toast up
Leanin' against my Zeniths, convertible tops and who's the cleanest
Them Click boys smobbin' deep in cuts, actin' meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new home
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out, ain't seen or heard from Potna Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti, dang near sheddin' tears, huh
See, first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, 1-Luv

Stood in front of the liquor house soakin up gidname, from old timers
Buy me a drank man I know it's against the law im underage be a good sport
What you need my little comrade a packet of kool-aid and some whiteport
What else? A thing of beedies and a short neck of Night Train
Whatchu gonna give me? A crumpled up foodstamp that I won in a dice game
Preciate it playa, I'm up out of this bitch bout to go hook up

Why was I born in these trifling ass times?
Why is it mandatory that I carry knives?
Don't be too liberal 'cause, see, white folks get jacked too
Doctors, high-class lawyers and even Japs too
You ask me why I speak the real, the way I feel
How come we call bitches hoes and y'all call us niggaroes?
They wanna do me like they did Stax
What is this young black man doing with all that scratch? Huh
I see some timers on the yayo track readin' they mail
Talking about ""I got white girl for sale""
But they ain't talking to me 'cause see I'm an oldie and they knows that
I used to be just like them, I tell them ""Y'all get that scratch""
Magazine was never nothing like Bel-Air
High-speed shootouts and shit, but I loved it there
""40, where you been, playa? It's been a while.""
'Marinatin', accumulating paper, pal'
""Y'all kinda doin' it, huh? You still grindin'?""
'Hell yeah, you know them tapes you keep rewinding'
Money ain't changed me, money changed the way people think about me
When I was broke all I had was my family
You know what kills me doe, them fuckin' numskulls
I hate when blacks be clownin' blacks on all these talk shows
It's bad enough we shootin' up each other tragically
Two days ago they found some brother smothered badly
Nobody's to be trusted in this day and age
Too much jealousy and envy on the wrong page
And fuck the po po's 'cause that 39% tax I pay
Don't get me nathan but a chokehold and some pepper spray

I came from the bottom of the barrel
To everyday new apparel, from a shoe string budget
To more jewelry than a pharaoh
About a place called Vallejo
House smaller than that hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweatin' over the stove
Seen 'em come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody less ya talkin' bout Pac
Just tryin' to survive and stay alive
So many of my people done died
Now days, you an OG, if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand daddy, doin' 25
Liftin' water bags, doin' Burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends, cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like bras, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me then call me up on the phone
They say 40 Water I just wanna be on

Yeah
Hey yo 40
Let me talk to you for a minute, homie
They say money make the world go round
And since I'm worth 20 mil
I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a Schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get cash
Money like Baby do, I gotta scar over my heart
Cause that's what hatin'll do
So watch ya back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't give a fuck about who the hardest
You lay with the people who more pray
Get ya name etched in stone, witcha born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the class, my mind starts packin' his Louis Vatton bags
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot gun blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arm
Can't you see he got piss bag?
17 years old and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold

The more you buy the less it costs
I could front you a few off the side
As long as your ass don't double cross
You crossed a lot of racoons
Get your cranium sawed off
I got mouths to feed my nigga
I can't afford to take no loss
I can give your ass a number
Its up to you to keep it quite
You can't be a punk about the hustle
You gotta keep the money coming
I'm out here
Dealing with these suckers
Stopping the fake ass busters
They stab your ass in the back
These brothers turn on you
I know when its gonna be a shortage
How long this shortage suppose to last
I ain't got the weather channel
To predict the forecast
The plan is hustling
Cause there ain't no work there
Ain't no job
So they stuck in playing this game
And the next thing they gonna rob
Bite the hand that feed em
That shit right there ain't y’all

A closed mouth dont get fed
And a lazy hustler don't get bread

Everybody think they know it all
Dont wanna hear nobody speak
Shut the fuck up and listen sometime

And act like they just it

Don't  wanna contribute nothing
But wanna help spend your ends
Think before you rocking your mouth
Park your tongue and lip
Watching who you talkin round
Never know who you're having dinner with
You ain't got nothing good to say
Dont say nothing at all
Thats what i was told
That's what i was taught when i was small
A lot of these so called artists got too much time on ya hand
Should be getting your money
On
Instead of hating on the next man
Its lonely at the top
But its next to crowded at the bottom
That's why I always keep my pistol cocked
In case i gotta stop ‘em

Trunk full of slap
Hollering at ‘em back

Pocket full of scraps
Nothing but thousand stacks
I’m old school acting a fool making my
Presence known
I look at business face to face
Dont like to talk on phones
When i'm at a stop sign or a red light I leave one car
Space in front of me
Tell it like it is
Just so i could have enough room to get up outta there
Just in case someone try to pop at me or something
Tell it like it is
Thats how i was raised
I'm still a student of the game
You could learn from a baby
I'ma tell it like it is

I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water

This that new water, this shit go
Water my grass and my green gone grow
It takes water to live, it's water under the bridge
Water with the baking soda whipping up kids

It's a drought without water, the soil can't crack
Water in the duals makes loud glass packs
My family know me by Earl but water my handle
All the gooing in the club, drinking water like a camel

Put some paint where it ain't, water based paint
If you don't drink no water, my ninja, you might faint
Water be everywhere but water from the V
Water be limping like he got water in his knee

Water pour, water simmer, water heat
Keep my head above water, still water run deep
Water in my bong, water do the fruit
Water trust no one, ain't no leaks in my pool

Water, water, water, water
Water, water, water, water

I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water

I don't be seeing anything, I be making sense
Y'all be looking for a walk, I be swing for the fence
Under pressure, never tense, rhyming is a synch
Change the rap game when they let me up off the bench

Back with that 91 super Atlantic flow
I've done seen your favorite rappers come and go
I done seen a lot of blow, a lot of snow
I done seen my homie grandma get beat by the po-po

In the hill side of Vallejo, County of Selano
Get off a magazine and meet me over there by McDonald's
That's why I used to get my yola stacks off
Back then I was small time, all I had was rocks

Manage with it, a fixture on the streets
He a vegan, he don't like beef
They got their E's mixed up
I just look like this but I'd fuck a nigga up

Water, water, water, water
Water, water, water, water

I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water
I wish I was 40, I wish I was water

I wish I was 40, I wish I was

Yokin' it up, tearin' it up
Wakin' 'em up, showin' my butt
Serving some weight, having my cake
Acting a ape, smoking my grapes

Lifted and splifted, whiskeyed and twisted
Me and my niggas get it and fit it
Makin' 'em mad, makin' 'em sad
Love to boast, love to brag

Slangin' them raps, selling these tracks
Up in ya broad, up in ya batch
My trunk is throbbing, my system knock
My amps is making my woofers pop

Fully refurbished, fully restored
70' Cutlass stick in the floor
Turfin' and crumpin', snapping and stepping
Trappin' and slumming, bangin' and reppin'

Chrome lips, chrome tips
Chrome everywhere, chrome on my hip
Reputable, intellectual

Adjusting my rates, bringin' new clients
Checking my traps, running my route

Hey, this is cooking with Brook

Today we're gonna be making c-crack

[Hook: Bun b & Brook from the Cooking Channel]
First take 36 ounces of coke
Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove
Next step to make them boulders add, baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, that's the recipe

[Verse 1: E-40]
Before you decide to elect yourself in the game of dope
Better know that it is cut throat
Can't be cracking under pressure when your backed in a corner
Against the ropes
They ain't calling it snitching no more
They calling it telling the truth
They say you better get down first
Before they decide to get down on you
Mixing it up, shake and bake
It's 2008, they got more data than '88
We used to make crazy cake, flipping weight
Gotta get in and out before it be too late
I don't want to be 6 feet under
So I pack and tote my thumper
Suckas want to hate and block my thunder
'Cause I got more kicks than a punter
Murder rates go up in the summer
Killers go hunting like a hunter
(How good can you live?)
You can live good for 6 years
But then it's football numbers

Sides lost lives, politics and drama
Over supersize, thump young in a hornya
Watch out for that boy in the hoodie, man, he a monster
Light a sucker up, fried buster like Chimichanga
Somebody come scoop his ass, call a coroner
I guess that's the way we bread
Chemical babies mislead
It's spooky out here in the Yay
These goblins will get on your head
These thundacat's management ain't scared to be deceased
They always cover up they ears
When I'm yelling and hollering out peace!
They going through it, they cranky, stressed out and tense
They starving, they hungry, they eating soup with chopsticks
Plus, it's a shortage on purple, and it's a drought on them bricks
So he'll go decide to do a kick door, and pull a few licks
Some of them parents on drugs, some of them never been loved
Some of them want to be thugs, some of them just need a hug

I'mma be around for a minute
So get used to it, I was through with it
Before most of you marshmallows knew want to do with it
Pushing them zones, serving that drome
Balling like I play hoop with it
Never at home, always be gone
Doing a show on the verse split
Let it be known, I tote my chrome
Refuse to get caught loose with it
Looking down at my shoe with it, I'mma real baboon with it
40 over there slipping, he snoozing, he ain't wake
He looking like a plate, he chipped up and draped
You fuck niggas got me fucked up, nigga, I'm a shooter
Think about the consequences, nigga, I got gouda
And niggas with gouda will send a nigga, fuck a case
Cause niggas with gouda will have your whole family erased
But that ain't something I endorse, I only wore it by force
I'm trying to teach the youth to be loyal and play sports
Instead of in and out of court
And back and forth to prison, utilize they skills
And stay up out the system

If I skunk you my ninja, you gotta drink two shots
Or we can play for some fedi, or we can play for pushups
Or we can put on the gloves, go from the shoulders box
After that we can hug get a room get props
All my fellas is thugs, ballheads dreadlocks

I seen a lot of pain since I was a child  so pray for me I’ve done a few things that just ain't right so pray for me
What I’ve been through will  make you cry so pray for me, pray for me ( for me )
Ooooh I'm trying to change my life so (pray for me )

[Verse 1]
Uh ain't no dope on the streets man I'm behind on my rent, I ain't got nothing to show for all the fetty that
I done spent I told my momma to cash out my life insurance policy, the money  that she was planning on using to bury me. man my rib touching my papers struggling man all my life
I've been hustling running in place but can't seem to finish the race
Seen dudes get whopped in the face plucked like a bass flew into space for senselessness
Thats why I stay prayed up and say my grace even when i'm blended never know when your life is suspended
God can take his arms from around you and easily end it at any time any place anywhere
I know that my lifes been a spared on several occasions suckas hating I’m still here
How come loved ones fall out never talk again to  each other?
Why does it take a funeral to bring family together? Bad weather always looks worse through a window. Stressin and rubbin my temples I make it look easy  but its really not all that simple

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Young dude full of soul food mama cooking pork chops  uncle slapping dominos sister playing hopscotch
And this before the block got hot and infected and everybody knew my granddaddy well respected check it !
Time went on and the game kicked in I was losing comrades either death or the penn
I was losing comrades but i'm stackin them ends we ever go to 600 how we losin our friends
When grandmama passed is when it all went bad
Aunties don't talk my cousins fightin is bad.  and theres no thanksgivings
Like the ones we had and its sad so i express through a pen and a pad
Im on my third wind pimpin knowin Jesus is with me ain't no weapon formed against me that could come and defeat me
I be post in the cuts when them angels come get me until the day homie, Just pray for me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My kin folk and baby mama on welfare they house is bigger than ours
Cuz they got section 8 vouchers WIC and benefit cards my homegirl daughter diabetic
She like to eat whole lot she only nine and a half and taking insulin shots
My dude got a heart condition his ankle be swollen cuz he got high blood pressure and he refuse to quit smoking
But I'm no better than ya’ll I like to drink alcohol
Bring out the pen and start writing about the things that I saw
Like kilograms of that raw and cut peruvian flake wrapped in aluminum foil and duct tape bust open
And thrown in a pot foamy and mushy melted and locked in a shape of a gigantic sized white cookie;
Put on the towel and dried and broken down into zips quarters and halfs and sixteenths of yola get flipped
I maintain my faith in G.O.D cuz its just a test, repent and confess extra grateful man yes Im blessed uh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(pray for me )Ooooooh im here right now

90 racks for the watch, 30 stacks for the chain
A 50 bar for the medallion, diamonds drippy like the rain
Lower development housing is where I was taught to talk my talk
In the thick of the smudge, the slime, on the tar like crosswalk
A young factor having scrilly, spending blue notes in a drought
Living for the moment, fuck further out
Tomahawk by my kidney, MCM belt
Fucker want beef, I'm make him a patty melt
I'ma see you about something, send my crash dummy
He ain't from Japan, but he like to play kamikaze
Your bitch got sloppy toppy, off of the ginger ale with Jack
She got that hot throat with a built-in thermostat
I'm smoking agricultural and vegetation in the backseat zone and blazin'
In the clean 19 with the dealership plates, insurance and registration
Garnished and decorated with all the toppings and all the fixings
We don't fuck with turf dirt, we only fuck with vixens

Hallelujuah! The Lord blessed me with gouda
You can find me on vacation in Barbados or Aruba
Puerto Villarta, Mexico, Bora Bora or Bermuda
Me don't do no snorkel, me don't do no scuba
Under difficult circumstances, I'm having my finances
Used to be the lowest man on the totem pole, used to be the brokest kid on campus
Way ahead of my time, the laughing stock in pre-school
Holes in my pants when ripped jeans wasn't cool
Beat the odds, count my blessings, it's a blessing
Praise God for replying to my message
Suckers don't understand me 'cause they ain't got no understanding
I'm out here feasting, I ain't famine, eating jasmine rice and salmon
Your little gutter chick ain't handling, got you sprung
Need to tell that hoe to douche and brush her tongue
Wandering eyes, wondering why I ain't calling
Come and get your bitch, she out here thottin', reckless eyeballin'...BIATCH!

Pots and pans, thugged out
Even in the church house on a Sunday
Ice up in my mouth, my grill look like an ice tray
Everything designer, customize fitted
Authentic material, cut and so knitted
Upper body flooded, water around my neck
Half an M it cost me for the whole set
Still wet behind the ears, ears wet
Living my second childhood, young vet
Bitch, I ain't ever wrong, I stay correct
Still got money in the streets from '88 that I need to go collect
I'll bust my TEC if I have to protect my well-being
I am an animal, not a human being
Color me a hustler, something that you ain't
I move around, paint the town, go hard in the paint

This an AP on my wrist, not a wristband
Taking risks in the kitchen, pepper in my hand

A champion in these streets when I was on the tar
Popular in my region, trench star
Triple beam boy, jelly jar
You suckers is bitches, body suits, leotard
Shout out to my vatos
E. Cuarenta Tequila and carne asada street tacos
Jarritos is my favorite soda
A dollar and some change it cost me for my Rover, uh
And fuck my enemies
Any of 'em threaten me then it's gon' be some life-threatening injuries
When they smelled that smell, they knew they was about to lose 'em
'Cause when you die, you have a bowel movement
Play with me, I lie in wait
Make you think that I'm scared, you'll meet your fate
Your life will be over, they'll close the drape
Bring the evidence markers, the white chalk and yellow tape

I'm a top hat, I'm a whale, I'm a fixture, bitch, I'm a tycoon
I drink cognac like Kim Jong Un
You bound to find me chiefin' with my heaters, I'm a patient
Functioning at a party on an Indian reservation
All the youngsters, they love it, they call me 'dad'
'Cause I'm the rawest rapper the West Coast ever had
I sell liquor, music, edibles, and vegetables
I do bar mitzvahs, arenas, and hella festivals

Desert Eagle pistol pack the Power like 50
My life is a highlight reel for real
Diarrhea of the mouth'll get you killed
I'm the oldest newest rapper in the industry
I've been spitting game for half a century
I could talk a flea off a Frenchie
Make an 18-wheeler truck pop a wheelie

Live on the edge on the San Andreas Fault
Being a sucker ain't the way that I was taught
You woulda thought it was a food fight the way they throwing salt
If I keep moving this fast, I'll probably get a ticket

Fuckin' in the car, you can't come to the pad, woo
Tell that bitch just relax
Deep dick so good, bitch, I might charge a tax, woo
Park the coupes back to back
30 in this clip, put your head in your lap, ooh
So broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out
Wah, relax, bitch, relax, wah, bitch
Broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out

Rob your ass, what the world meaning to you

Balenciaga shoe box, lump sums in large amounts
I grew that shit now I got savings and checking accounts
From a eight of them flowers to a pick of Europa
Same hustle, different products just trying to get over
The institution of the streets will have them rush ya'
I got octopus arms, reach out and touch ya'

Any place I plant my feet, I told her toasty
Wrap a sucker up, fold him just like ravioli
Stay in the car, I ain't got time for carpool karaoke
This ain't musical chairs hoe, this ain't no hokey pokey
The pack has just landed 06:30 sharp, a.m
Sent the bitch to receive down at the other end

Semi, semi, semi, semi, semi, semi
RIding with the hemmy, hemmy, hemmy, hemmy

Put your bitch on the road, tell her cash that
Blue cooking enchilada is the best bet
Every nigga want war, you know we stress that
We gon' pull up with them choppers and a hatchback
I just let go the sun and my neck dance
My little bitch drinking a dub, she just left Lancet

Put her right back on a roll she just go the cancer
Bitch keep asking all these questions like I got the answers
50 niggas I know, man i bled like the black panthers
2-2-3 struck you down, you shoulda ran faster

I put a quarter on my wrist just for speaking words
I put a tracker on my bitch thanks to them birds
My nigga Scooper and his bitch on a surfboard
Try to reach for one of us, you'll get hurt for it
They 'bout to land

The throb slap in the Ghost
Put your finger on the trunk, feel the pulse
I never leave the teepee without the toast
You see the liquid on my chain, I flamboast
When I'm higher than Pluto, I eat menudo
Pozole elote, might think I'm an esé
I sleep with my cuete, I'll leave your ass muerte
Vallejo, Cali-harm-ya, 7-O-siete
The Good Book is my buckler and shield
Death could come outta nowhere, like when the rock hit your windshield
That's why I always keep a rototiller
When I'm out there in the field in the traffic making deals
Every stack I get, like Kaepernick, I kneel
Ain't talking about no dinner but I need a meal
Release my niggas down waiting for appeal
In a gladiator tank, sharks and eels...BIATCH!

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
And these days, gotta watch who you trust
Keep that pistol by my side, in this block I trust
I came from nothin' so I had to run it up
They just wanna see me fail, they don't wanna see me up
And I know the Lord chose me
To have the vision in what most don't see
I got money, started hating on me
Niggas that I used to love tryna stonewall me
And I know money bring hate but I'ma keep getting this cake
And no, my soul won't change
Real niggas can't relate to the fake
And niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball
I know niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball, ball

[Verse 2: E-40]
Off top Tommy, rollin' up a mummy
Thumbin' through his money, thumper by his tummy
Blowin' on a branch, higher than an avalanche
Hazy like a forest fire in a Napa Valley ranch
Cash flow Cliff, sippin' on a fifth
Spill more liquor on his shirt, got a hole in his lip
Sitting on some cheddar and them niggas know better
Semi-auto wetter fly your head like a feather
Honey coochie slap, smell like a Life Saver
Baby booty stacked like a Sunday newspaper
Bitch, I'm a mack, not a caped crusader
Captain-Save-a-Batch? Nope, I check yaper
Money on my mind, money on my mind
If I do the crime, I'ma do the time
Never drop a dime, never drop a dime
Hold water on my chest, high alkaline

What kind of human beings are we really?
What has gone into the shaping and molding of who we are
Both as persons as well as communities and traditions?
The inescapability of traditions
For me the greatest tradition is spiritual fortitude in the modern world, which is the black musical tradition
There's never been a tradition on such intimate terms of catastrophe and still able to generate such unbelievable forms of creativity, compassion, and fortitude

[Verse 1: E-40]
When it was my aisle turn to get up and view the casket
Couldn't hold my tears back, it was automatic
When the reverend started preaching, it was sad
After the funeral, I hugged his mom and dad
Paid for the memorial, 7000 dollars cash
Only time we get together is when somebody pass
The story of many people I narrate
Hella hate divide and conquer, separate
When I was born, momma didn't feed any baby food to this infant
She fed me collard greens, dressing, candied yams, and fried chicken
In the trenches, we trippin', got trials and tribulations
Renovation, they forcing us out, gentrification
Living in the Bay, it's expensive, it's hard to bargain
2500 a month to rent a 1 bedroom apartment
Cancer don't care how old you are or who you are (no, no, no)
Live your life every day like it's no tomorrow (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Health can be your best friend or worst enemy, could be ruthless
Lou Gehrig's Disease, leukemia, and lupus
No Medi-Cal insurance so we self-medicate
Eat tomatoes 'cause it helps protect the prostate
Some of my potnas vegan, some just watch the way they eat
Substitute ground turkey for ground beef, no red meat
It's mainey outchea, it's murkish and it's sick
Everybody outchea carry and pack a pogo stick

[Chorus: Mike Marshall + (E-40)]
Life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah, life is much different 'round here (Uh)
But we don't give up
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (Shows up)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)
But we still rise up (Uh)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Every day somebody fighting for they life
Every second it's a body put on ice
Maggots, flies, vultures, parasites
Tag on they toe without a price
In the middle of the slums rockin' crumbs
Secondhand smoke all in our lungs
Weikel's, Smart & Final, Target
You liable to find me up in Chavez Supermarket
The homie's kids and his nephews tryna rap
Say that's the only way to get up out the trap
Gettin' on somethin' they only content
I tell them they can be an astronaut or an accountant
Can't wait to get papered up with designer belt on my pants
Do the money dance with the money phone in my hand
Loved ones in a situation and need some cash?
Send it through Square Cash, they'll get it fast
When I finally catch a break, it's voodoo
Every time I catch a break, it fall through
Life is against me, the devil's on me
He shady, he janky, he ain't my homie
Temptation is vicious, you gotta watch all these bitches
They'll line you up with no clippers, do anything for they niggas
Life is an assignment, it's a test
Repent, thank God, and confess

[Chorus: Mike Marshall + (E-40)]
Oh, life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah, life is much different 'round here (What you say?)
But we don't (we don't) give up (give up)
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (whoa)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)
But we still rise up (look here)
Life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah life is much different 'round here (it's so different round here)
But we don't give up (it's so different round here)
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (when life shows up)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (life shows up)
But we still rise up (well...)

'Cause I'm a Jesus loving free Black man
But I was in deep solidarity and remain so
With the focus on those poor, precious, priceless children
Even today, one out of two black and brown children live in poverty",westcoast
