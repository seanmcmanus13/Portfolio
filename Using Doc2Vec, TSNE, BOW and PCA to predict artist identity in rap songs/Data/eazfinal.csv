Good evening, and welcome to Eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka!
Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it, bitch?

[Ice Cube + Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
I knew this nigga back in, uh, uh—back since a nigga was little
(You lying, you lying man)
The nigga come from Compton, Michigan, nigga
(Compton what? You ain't never met no Eazy-E)
Well, I'ma introduce him (You a damn liar!)
This is the craziest motherfucka you done seen (You a damn liar!)
This nigga's crazy—just listen!

[Verse 1]
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I'll need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'Cause I do a check—nut 1, nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, 'cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it, I'm still talkin' shit

[Interlude: Ice Cube + Dr. Dre]
Ha ha, I told you that nigga was crazy
Eazy Eric, that's my boy, ha ha, godamnit
Go on, boy, wit' yo' bad self
Step up to the mic, nigga (Ay bitch, pass me my Ripple)

[Verse 2]
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's Sharon, the other one Shaun
I wanted to nut, but which one do I want?
Shaun said, ""Eazy, let me fuck you blind""
And Sharon said, ""E, I want to blow your mind""
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the other pussy, put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah, that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
""Here's what I'm gonna put inside""
Grab it like a rabbit (grab it), let's work it (work it)
But I won't love you—when I'm done, I'll still be talkin' shit ...

[Interlude: Ice Cube + Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
Ha ha, that boy good (Yeah, that boy's good)
(That muthafucka be talkin' all kinds of shit)
I used to get pussy like Eazy Eric every day
(You ain't no motherfucker) How you know, muthafucka?
(You're lyin', your dick can't get hard)
Oh, suck my dick, muthafucka (Nigga, you lyin')
Who you talkin' to? Well, get up then, nigga, shit...

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
Ayo Yella boy, why don't you rewind it

[Verse 3: Eazy-E ]
Niggas don't see I'm a 100 percent legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by Eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
I might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of y'all can just suck my dick
You could quote me now 'cause I'm still talkin' shit

[Interlude: Ice Cube + Dr. Dre]
The boy's good—I told you, boy
(Ay, I knew him when he was knee-high)
The nigga got talent—you don't know a damn thing
(I knew him when he was knee-high)
He still is knee-high, muthafucka
(Yeah, I like that part—bring that shit back one more time, Maestro)
That's that old Z.Z. Hill, huh? Ha ha ha
I tell ya, boy, I can do the Mashed Potato, nigga, what can you do?
(Muthafucka, I can do the boogaloo, I can do the boogaloo)
Boogaloo!? That old shit been played out back in 1967

MC Ren: Believe that, boy
Eazy-E: You're strapped?
MC Ren: Yeah, you know it
Eazy-E: Let's go do this shit, man, I got it all planned out
MC Ren: Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves

[Sample]
Alright everybody

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie em up for the fact that I'm kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what, no need for shaking, because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearing a badge, but he's a ol' ass man
Pop his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know so me and my gang, just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers could see
And smile, you know, cause I'm control of the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so

[Hook]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt [gunshot]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt [gunshot]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt [gunshot]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt gunshot

[MC Ren]
Alright, anybody move and I'll blow your fucking head off

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Alright, empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fucking floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Taking all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughing at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not saying a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin'
And then untie the ho, so I can start creepin'
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was going up in her
The suspense was making me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand
(What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man)
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so

[Hook]

(I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot)

[Verse 3: Eazy-E +  MC Ren ]
Stacking up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveller's cheques
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
Three motherfucking police staring at me; what to do now?
Hurry up and get armed
Alright, tell me, who hit the motherfucking alarm?
I'mma give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of y'all bitches are comin with me
(Alright, Alright, come on out niggas, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in)
Fuck you, we got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sending out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
(They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage)
You stupid motherfucker trying to run
Now you're dead as fuck trying to race a gun
(Alright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast)
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin'
With screamin hostages, running and chokin'
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfucking cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is

I'm gonna shoot two of your guards)

Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin'
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but
He'll get away without leavin' a clue

Dr. Dre: Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
Eh yo Yella boy why don't you rewind it
Hey, man you gotta get more hyped up than that

Leave your shit unlocked and it's stealin'
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but
He'll get away without leavin' a clue
Keepin' shit in control like the neighborhood chief but
Referred to as a walking thief
They say he's a bad influence for the kids on the block
Why the fuck they blamin' him he's the one that they jock
Keepin' niggas in line, whoever fucks with his rhyme
And before you fuck with him you gotta fuck with his nine
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga
He could whoop his ass cause he's bigger
Size don't mean shit he's from the old school fool
He's a villain from the streets and he's supposed to rule
Not sayin' he's in shit but he's down for mine
He was put on the streets to keep niggas in line
Never givin' a fuck, cause you jealous of E
Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be
He can't help it he's in shit but he don't hold shit back
He's a gangsta in black and he's about to attack

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Ruthless gangsta, definition villain
You can lock up yo' shit, he's still stealin'
Gettin' respect cause the boy kicks butt
But the real meaning is he don't give a fuck
It's Eazy-E in the crowd but he's not in the 4
I tell his money flow as he collects from his ho'
All expenses paid for the rhymes that he made
Gold trophies in the house for the girls that he laid
Not a wimp he's a pimp, now of course he's the boss
So keep your bitch out his face or else she's gonna get tossed
Too hard to be fucked with, the boy got heart
Wanna fuck with him, he'll rip your head apart
Gangsta Gangsta, that's what they yellin'
But him with his gangsta stroll he keeps bailin'
Wherever he goes there's no discussion but silence
They say that he's the one promotin' gang violence
That's a lie just a critic all that whack bullshit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with

[Hook: Eazy-E]

Automatic heavily, I start firing
And the kids on the block, I'm the one they're admiring
A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talking some shit and I'mma bust your lip

Now this is some shit -  Yo what are you saying

[Verse 1]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad, throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo', hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by N.W.A
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there, cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

[Hook]
'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Get the fuck out!
Pump that beat!
Mothafucka, say what?

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man J.D. is on freebase
The boy J.D. was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car, tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard

Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit

Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out

I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh, brother
I'll throw it in the gutter and go buy another.""
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge

Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches

So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafuckas, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)

[Verse 3]
Now I'ma break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the SHIT I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

[Hook]
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy, you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

[Outro]
From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obsolete
A nigga with a serious ass attitude and a hundred percent street
And if you all wanna hear some more...
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother

People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set, hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal - Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless, when I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

(Eazy)I wear my pants like this, fo' easy access baby

Yo homeboy, where we takin' this jam to?
COMPTON
Where?
COMPTON
Alright

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Yeah 'cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

Yo man, you weren't born in no '73
Why you be lyin' bout your age?
(Eazy-E)
Man, why you gotta bring that up?
Yo, get this fool outta here!

Hey Eazy why you always cussin' on your records?
(Eazy-E)
Who are you, Gene Autry or somethin'?
I just do that to get my point across
Now I wanna know who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it

Yo man I don't think they heard you
Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is

[Eazy-E]
My name is Eazy yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I cold get ill
But I'm like that and thats an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm displayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Eazy's doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo it's Eazy-er Said Than Dunn

[Hook]
Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

[Eazy-E; MC Ren]
Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like you're there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on Ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and cold bust the fat cables, boy
Master Rhyme's a toy
I mean straight, while you suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick, or you lonely
How you gonna diss me if you don't even know me?
Yo Ren!
Whassup?
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin your cap
To let you know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall Be Dunn

[Hook]
Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

[Eazy-E; MC Ren]
Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
Eazy-er said than Dunn yeah thats the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
But what if she's ugly?
Eazy come Eazy go
Don't ask to battle me, homeboy, what's that?
You wanna battle me, boy ya better be strapped
Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
[*gun shots*]
Now that's what I'm sayin'
Said before that I was born in '73
Now everybody wants to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip, fellas too, it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellas would annoy me
The ladies would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' but to let the lady's through
Cause the ladies I love 'em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Eazy cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some

Greg Mack: What's it called man?
MC Ren: Yo, it's called ""Radio""
Greg Mack: We got it, you called the right station. And here it is

[Verse 1]
Eazy E rockin' non stop on the radio
With the funky fresh hip hop in stereo
Release some rhymes that you will find demandin'
With Dre's beats that are so outstandin'
I'm gettin' busy if you know what I mean
Always settin' me a mark in the hip hop scene
On the radio the greatest of all times
Like Muhammad Ali cause I punch rhymes
So tune your station, and clear all the static
And tell the truth: you didn't know that I had it
In me, to be easy about the situation
So just kick it and listen to the station
Playin' my music, it's hard to lose it
It's constantly on request cause you choose it
I'm Eazy E, my rap is strong
And your radio's def when my record's on

[Verse 2]
Now I wanna turn up my box, and make much noise
And rock the party and shock all the B-boys
Take on my radio from phono to tuner
I wouldn't have did it, later but sooner
Now I move my antenna to the center
Then grab a hold of the handle and enter
Then bust a rhyme, you know I won't quit it
Am I lyin', Ren ? (Man, you know you're with it)
Your request is clear, that you're givin'
Without Eazy E you wouldn't be livin'
With me on a top 10, or a mix show
So hit your power button, and let's go
On vacation, with your station
That's playin' live in every location
Blowin' out ya speaker
It won't get weaker
I'll keep rockin' till I hit the peek
And your station is dope E-A-Z-Y
It's on the air, but you axe why
I took out the cursin', and took rehearsin'
I feel dry, you know that I'm thirstin'
To get busy; I don't quit it
And once you hear my cut, I know you're gonna get it
Then bust a rhyme, while you're clappin' your hands
It's Eazy E on the air (rockin' without a band)

Now disc jockeys are playin' me in rotation
Hittin' number one spots across the nation
I'm on the charts, you can go list'em
But now listen, I'm on your system
AM or FM, I'm in power
You hear my music once every hour
So listen up to the rhyme and percussion
But do this with no discussion
Eazy's easin' fans I'm pleasin'
Why, I'm on top yo, I got reason
With no profanity, but what can I say
Yo Dre (What up ?) Do it your way
On the radio you get more looser
Take my word you're a dope producer
We combine to put out hits
But jealous people, they just have fits
Cause we get airplay, but we're not thru
Dre, am I serious ? (Cold word) Well thank you !
People that hear me, they know what I'm sayin'
On the air, I don't be playin'
Just gettin' my point across to the public

We're sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

[Verse 1]
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin sure no punks are runnin' up
(​Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun)​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin', and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
(Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?)
Hell naw! Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So... you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

[Interlude: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" someone?

[Verse 2]
Wait... for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in... all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, 'cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall... don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So... is there any more questions?

[Interlude: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is...
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a 211?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
(Were you slick?)
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it""
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
(Is all that true?)
I don't lie
You see... I'm not mister nice guy

[Interlude: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

[Outro: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T

My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin' out profanity so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the hi-hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy that
The E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental thats recorded
Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of trophy like a plaque
And some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Don't attempt the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious create sounds so quit playin' around
'Cause I'ma break it down

[Verse 2: Eazy-E +  MC Ren ]
Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckas were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tempo or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckas that soften
Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then
You got bitches chill and I'ma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'ma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
'Cause a percentage on pork bellies are very low
Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rushed to the dirt
I'm not a lawman, but I'ma raw man
But ya the dopest one I ever saw man
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen up, 'cause I'ma break it down

[Verse 3]
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And compliments for the rhyme that's made
Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat
Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
'Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax
Doin' a solo in the shade, I'm a spotlight
Relax and chill while your uptight
Pumpin' up the funky sounds

That the E is gonna break it down",westcoast

This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10, and it reads:
It's time to put some niggas in check
When you shoot a gun, hot shells eject
Catch 'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for finger prints
You ask why am I like this
Cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it how I know it, just hope the fuck I don't show it
Niggas out frontin', loitering and looting
Let's recreate a drive-by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun, Mack-10 and an AK
They roll through to a line of niggas
It was 9 just like the fuck they figured
Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights off, car's in neutral, rollin' at a snail's pace and creepin'
Hoping to catch all of them sleepin'
A so-called gang, drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all the others jet, 3 of 'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scene, with gun shot wounds
3 dead because Compton is scandalous
I'd like to tell you, brother, ashes to ashes, dust to dust (Amen)

(We want Eazy!)
Ayo Yella boy, take me to the bridge

[Bridge: Dr.Dre]
(Get funky with it)

Everybody in the house!

Come on, say Eazy, Come on!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it!
(We want Eazy!)
Ayo Eazy, kick me another verse

[Verse 2: Eazy-E + Dr. Dre]
Yeah 'cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

(Eazy!)
Everybody come on!
(Eazy!)
Get those hands back in the air!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it
(Eazy!)
Come on, everybody, come on!
(Eazy!)
I can't hear you
(Eazy!)
A little louder, come on, say it!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it
(Eazy!)
Ayo Yella boy, you know what time it is

[Bridge: Eazy-E + Dr. Dre]
(Eazy, hey Eazy!)
Wassup?
(Why do you wear your pants like that?)
I wear my pants like this for easy access, baby
Yeah, that's right
(Ey homeboy, where we taking this jam to?)
(COMPTON)

(COMPTON)
(Aw yeah)
Now I wanna know who ya came to see

(Eazy!)
Ayo, this record's almost over
(Eazy!)

(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it!
(Eazy!)
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
(Eazy!)
Everybody in the house!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say Eazy, come on!
(Eazy!)
Ayo, who y'all want?
(We want Eazy!)
Ayo Ren, let's kick another verse

[MC Ren & Dr. Dre]
Ren and Dre, the Villian and the Doctor together
Yo we can rock by ourselves, but we're together whenever
A funky track is included, it's getting better, not worse
Especially when Eazy's here to kick another verse

[Verse 3]
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it

[Bridge: Eazy-E + Dr.Dre]
(Eazy!)
Ha ha ha ha!
Who y'all want?
(We want Eazy!)
Aw yeah
(Eazy!)
All of me
Why not take all of me?
(We want Eazy!)
Who'd y'all come to see
(Eazy!)
Yeah
Yeah
(We want Eazy!)
Can I get down one time?
(Eazy!)
Yeah, you know what time it is
(We want Eazy!)
Yo stag, give me a funky solo homeboy

(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
All of me
Why not take all of me?
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
Turn this mother out!
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
All of me
Why not take all of me?
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
Alright
Have a break right here
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
Check this out
(Eazy!)
*scatting*
(We want Eazy!)
(Eazy!)
Yo we just dropped a bomb on you
(We want Eazy!)
Check it out
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)

[Verse 4]
Said it before, a miracle, a lyrical, and ever
Something that suckers can never sever
Sit for a second and check what jockeys are brazing
Pure dope, figure it out like amazing
Come to grips with the fact, Eazy-E ain't a lightweight
Nervous never, you could get broke with your brake
So if you're smart, take me from the start
The boyz 'n the hood are always hard
Time for a show, the stage I hit, and it's legit
'Cuz the crowd be like tripping and the girls be having a fit
It's like a riot, someone said I'm at the high
Everybody wants to scream and I try to get 'em quiet
To continue, never the less, they're on a mission to perditious
And to be in company with my permission
Exceptional, speaking of the E in Eazy-E
I gotta hear it, tell 'em who you came to see

(Eazy!)

The bad guys are coming
[?]
We're all talkin' shit now
[?]
I ain't gonna miss this

[Intro: Ice Cube +(Dr.Dre)]
Remix my black ass
(Heh heh heh heh, hey man, that little nigga gettin' his ass whipped)
Wait...this shit sound familiar
(Hey, hey wait a minute goddammit it that the only thing y'all motherfuckers know how to play?)
Flip it on the B-side motherfuckers!
(Been playin' that shit all night)
[?]

[Verse 1]
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I'll need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'Cause I do a check—nut 1, nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, 'cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it, I'm still talkin' shit

[Interlude: Ice Cube + (Dr. Dre)]
Ain't that a bitch
(Ain't that a bitch)
Motherfucker you need yo little ass whooped
(Quit blowin' smoke in my damn face motherfucker)
Boy, boy, say something I won't listen to

[Bridge]
Eazy (Eazy), The E-A-Z-Y-E
If it sounds complicated then read the marquee
Ruthless (Ruthless), label me or label my label
A cable for the bitches and niggas I throw in ditches
Smoke 'em (Smoke 'em), it ain't nothing for me to kill 'em
And carry 'em, to the grave, recite and then I bury 'em
Making sure I create enough space
To drop his ass in while I'm dropping this motherfuckin' bass

[Interlude: Ice Cube + (Dr. Dre)]
I still can do the Mashed Potato motherfucker!
What can you do?
(I thought you said you were from Compton, Michigan
Ain't no such thing as Compton, Michigan motherfucker you lied to me)
Nigga Compton, California motherfucker

[Verse 2]
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's Sharon, the other one Shaun
I wanted to nut, but which one do I want?
Shaun said, ""Eazy, let me fuck you blind""
And Sharon said, ""E, I want to blow your mind""
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the other pussy, put it in the freezer (freezer)
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer (skeezer)
Yeah, that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
""Here's what I'm gonna put inside""
Grab it like a rabbit (grab it), let's work it (work it)
But I won't love you—when I'm done, I'll still be talkin' shit ...

[Interlude: Ice Cube + (Dr. Dre)]
This remind me of that old [?] joint Miss Mabel had, you could have all the fat bitches you want, and I have a goddamn [?]

[Bridge]
Fuck it (fuck it), the new, the old, the ordinary
Obviously, you can't hang with my commentary
I don't give a fuck what's up, you wanna get up?
Nope, cause you a sucker motherfucker
Dre kicks the bass, and I talk shit
That's it, that's all
Because to call a bitch a bitch, you gotta have balls
Slap a hoe across the face, and talk shit to the motherfuckin' kick, of the motherfuckin' bass

[Interlude: Ice Cube + (Dr. Dre)]
Didn't I tell you that nigga was crazy
Remind me of that [?] motherfucker
Y'know he sayin' howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howw
(Get yo motherfucker hands off me motherfucker)
You back off you ugly motherfucker
(Suck my dick)
Lick my balls motherfucker!
(Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this dumb shit
Ayo Yella Boy, why don't you rewind it)

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Niggas don't see I'm a 100 percent legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho' (that ho')
Just throwin' me the pussy (pussy)
She says she wants to do it like a doggy (doggy)
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter (platter)
Bitch on the gank move (gank move), to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by Eazy"" (Eazy)
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
I might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth (my mouth)
You don't like what I'm talkin' about? (about)
All of y'all can just suck my dick
You could quote me now 'cause I'm still talkin' shit

[Outro: Ice Cube + (Dr. Dre) + Eazy-E]
This ain't no CP Hill, motherfucker
This sound like that Parliament Funk [?]
Yo yo, watch me do this
*piano notes*
{?}
Ester, I'm coming to see ya honey
[?]
That boy Eazy, and the nigga on the side, you know, that right around the corner from him
(Damn lie)
The nigga be livin' around the corner
(You be talkin' too much shit)
Nigga, I was in 3 World Wars, nigga
(Motherfucker I knew the nigga when he was knee high)
I'm still talkin shit!
I used to court the motherfucker, I used to change his shitty ass diapers
(That's a damn lie)
He ain't lyin'
Put 'em up motherfucker, put 'em up
(Put 'em up)
C'mon motherfucker
You better cut that old shit out, or I'll come over and pee on one y'all motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothing but a goddamn thang on my slang, I can rap, look
