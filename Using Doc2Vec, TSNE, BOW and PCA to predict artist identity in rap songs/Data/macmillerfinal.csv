I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, ""Ow,"" make 'em say, ""Oh""
The hoes that tell me ""yes"", the same ones that tell you ""No""
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever",eastcoast

It's 'bout to be big shit poppin' by the time this shit is droppin'
Stoppin' not a option, I’m addicted, it’s a problem
This way of life, sex, drugs, rock and roll on the road
Feeling blessed performin' for sold out shows
You rappers talkin' shit what you know bout those
What you know bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes
It’s unbelievable these people say I made it
Throwin down a little Henny, can’t believe that I don’t chase it
Life goes on, days get brighter
I’m feelin like I came in with my haze no lighter
So I’m lookin for the missing piece
Goin down in history for rippin’ beats
Smooth game sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
You tune into my station hope you listening
Turn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream
All natural Whole Foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is happy like a show tune
This a brand new world I can show you
Some people still have no clue
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce

[Chorus]
In a world, that go round, are you up or you down
You in or you out
You smile or you frown
Just get up, get up
In a world, that go round, are you up or you down
You in or you out
You smile or you frown
Just get up, get up


[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ayo, I’m fast lane switchin', rap game spittin'
Chillin' with some sour, got a bad dame twistin'
These people think I’m goofy, say I’m Max they trippin'
Cause life a comedy like my last name Griffin
Livin' for the moment, blowin' potent overloaded
And my swagger call me old spice
Yeah the kid is so nice
Smokin' in the whip chillin, duckin' from the police
So bright you know lights, I’m shinin' like a strobe light
Leave a show with money and I always count my dough twice
Most Dope general, and that shit is for life
My mama taught me well so I even treat these hoes right, I’m polite
Workin' in my office, but no Dwight
Coke white skinded, no light dimness
Me who I am plain sight for these bitches
And I ain’t even tryna fight with these bitches
And I don’t got time to spend a night with these bitches",eastcoast

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

See I was 6 years old with a dream
When my Moms told me I can do anything
Said she’d be there forever
No matter what’s the weather
She’d always have my back even when we weren’t together
And I took her for granted
Thought I had a plan
This a different generation
I don’t think you’d understand
In the quest to be a man
You start to learn you need your family
It wasn’t for them, I’d be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity
Think about what's important
The reason I was 6 years old rocking some Jordans
The reason I had food
My own damn room
A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her
The world’s best mother
Yeah it ain't fair
So I’ma take care of her and her gray hair
When I get rich, I’ll have her living how she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me cause it’s

Hey, hey, hey
Dear mama, please don’t start to cry
You the reason I’m alive
How these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike ride - riding in the street
That delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench
When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I’m always welcome when I’m back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say “wassup” before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you in your bed, shit
You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh
I wanna tell you momma…

Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride

Nothing like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shining like my high beams cooler than some iced tea
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shopping and you would think she worked at retail
Snapbacks make em look so cute and that girl know how to blow
Something like she played the flute
That long hair and it’s falling down her back
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can’t have this
She smiled big, kissing on my cheek
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me

She like to play her stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin’ that’s what’s up
And I hear her name’s pretty from different continent
Telling me she’s single but to tell the truth I’m not convinced
It’s all good I’m used to boyfriends always talking shit
Thinking that they players but I’m coach call me Popovich
Baby I ain’t doctor rich, but I’ll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight
And we ain’t seen her since so tell me what does that look like
I’m the type to bring you right back down to earth
And for what it’s worth I’ll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I’m guessing she a keeper

Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of molly make your boy bite down
Thinking I could probably figure out my style on a stage
Looking at a big high crowd
They go insane when I run out the stage
Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old I'mma spend my days
Laying with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success so I'mma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God he'll be impressed cause
I've been on my grind, thinking I'll be fine if I take my time
Working so hard I might break my spine
So all yall goin' see this face of mine
There's different ways to shine
I'mma find my own, know when I disappear
I'mma find my way back home cause...

Looking at a constellation

Just kick it in the cut playing bingo

Look sweet honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thang
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna loose that ring
I don't pay her no mind, I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the games a little more flavor
Say what up, take a flick with a hater
Throwing a deuce like see you later
That's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life is gonna be so sweet, nah it ain't a hotel, nah it ain't a hotel

I can ignore it? Aight

And I don't mean ill like really cool and awesome
I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness

[Verse 1]
Well I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven’t slept in like five days
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend, though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a living
If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer then a Snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool

[Hook]
Wake up in my bed, gettin’ head, she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start
If you didn’t make mistakes, you wouldn't get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try

[Verse 2]
Ay, yo, my herb smoke tasting like a Nerds rope
I'mma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Something like a millionaire in training
Still my shit amazing, we jumpin' over puddles when it's raining
Planning on a tan, I’m in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancing on the clouds until I’m landing in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standing on the couch
But now I’m making so much money I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah I’m only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rapping twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art

It feels great to see my family proud, but
I make mistakes too
My people always tell me Mac
Please don’t ever let the fame change you

Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray

Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I’m on a balcony

Don't argue to death, pull my heart out of my chest
The cards is all on the table, I'm callin' it
Don't say it, I swallow it

It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

[Chorus]
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
I ain't askin' ""Why?"" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...

You could have the world in the palm of your hand
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em ""red light, stop it""
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

[Verse 1]
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot o' dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall, the grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (it gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, but, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hand
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes

Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Never mind, did I mention I'm
Fine, 'cause her pussy gettin'
Wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off
And everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5""
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happening, my man
No relaxing, kicking back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em fuck you, but that come on too strong
My god, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back to where I'm from

Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varying from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doing shows daily call me John Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred g's so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah I said it publically so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

[Interlude]
Hold up Jerm let me spit the second

[Verse 2]
Hey yo I breeze past haters in the E-class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and that’s this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong
Yeah, on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gonna see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn turn sound into somethin' so cool
Fresh kids, see me I'm bustin' the moves
Coming in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Ohh, I switch flows switch rhythm

Still kick raps like karate heroes
Doing things to the highest point, get deniro

Got a check with all them zeroes
Played my radio, could be rockin' sooner
All haters and bullies think that I'm a loser
When I show what I got to rule the mic
Hands down, the only one who gets it right
Now don't try a start up a fight
Cause I'mma start a riot
While im cookin' im too hot to bring a lighter
What's that? You said party there later?
I'll be at home workin'

And while I'm up at home I won't forget to give shoutout
Shoutout to Tone, Shoutout to Chao
And everyone in BOM, who made me feel strong
People are inspired now and sing along
To every single song that i play can make a party
Makin' sure I don't forget to bring some drinks
And of course some food, people are gettin hungry
But party's for later at 6:00 downtown

Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mofucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit
So make a toast to the good life

Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo!
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do, probably yes
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends
Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say get some rest, when I die, I'mma sleep in

[Verse 1]
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you
Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke
And I ain’t no hipster, but girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin’ to be left to die

I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch

Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

I got my own stickers now so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don’t know ‘bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck who's saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I’m the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I’m just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin’ it and goin’ in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn’t fuckin’ know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball

We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I’mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights, ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu

They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you

Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9""
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine
Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing but some deja vu, yeah",eastcoast

Come and talk shit, who the boss bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock a smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with single ladies, yea I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
Buy her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady

Everyone I came with travel like a gang bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language

Got all these people askin' what's next
Success and a dumb fresh life
Taking bets, you trying to lose a little money tonight

Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awnin'

Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses

[Verse 1]
Ay yo I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell him come and bring a meal in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques
Take it back cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, *Rellim Cam*, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah, treat em' like a bellhop
Let em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

Ay yo I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'
Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De Niro
I be low, key though, young nino with my jeans low
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go *moaning*
You can hear the way she's moaning
Started back at midnight, had it 'til the morning
Wake up with some morning wood
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would
All my female fans like, ""I'm sure it's good""

She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
She want to hit the beach, and show her titties down in Key West
Someone leave her crying all the time and now she finally out of Kleenex
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect
Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And falling all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only coming through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gonna do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gonna trust you, but she gonna fuck you

But she's scared to let you get too close
And she's been high and she's been low

And she ain't hiding
Until she finds her place back home
And then she's finally all alone

In high school they were callin' her a slut
But now she coming up, Louis Vuitton and Juicy on her butt
See the bitches that be hatin' like ""What's up?""
Cause they ain't doing nothing and she out here stuntin'
Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin'
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, cause she want to eat for free
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough

Ripping people's hearts out, are you too cute for that, cute for that

I observe, asking what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime

Simple living, I'm a hypocrite
Cause I'm filthy rich, I got businesses
Been had wifey's, have mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening
The war ain't winning, it just beginning
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
LeBron left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap

How much more money can you make?""

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker (50 million dollars!)
I stuck around for the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

[Outro: Vinny Radio]
Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the baby face Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Know what I'm talking about
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Feel that, go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will",eastcoast

Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (let's have some fun)
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my longterm goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say ""Soulo, you so crazy and deranged"", I say I know
Roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) and our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia

In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words were probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner
Shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
Better find that thing you die for
I don't know why what I get so high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...

Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me? Stop tripping, I'm fine

Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple (simple!)
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius
Sin everyday, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees
I'm the plug, what you need though? I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat (Wait, what?)
I made a mil' before I paid a bill
Cause  fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL

As we keep living and as we keep being positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories
Mac Miller, I love you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
All of my homies used to get on my case like ""When you 'bout to kill 'em?""
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

[Hook: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies
Time flies, try to catch it

[Interlude: Lil B]
Watch as time go
Time moves, time flows
How do we handle these things?
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams are manifested
From my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive
But I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with an ego big as Texas
Thinkin' ""I'm the man"", I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

[Hook: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies
Time flies, try to catch it

One day we will, we will find
We will conquer, conquer with love
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on

What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine

She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's

Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded

I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them ""shhh"" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet

[Hook: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah, I been riding through the city
Blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special
I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now
Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound,  turned that to a house
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
Spending all your time just getting high will drive you crazy
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I probably could've been the president

[Hook: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window

[Intro]
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
(Fuck you) I came for whoever is in charge
I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard
They need some coffee, everybody’s sleeping on me
Going around door to door, setting off alarms
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant
You can see it from a scar face
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil with me and he tell me to shoot

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday
Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay
Broad’s a baton, pass it off like relay
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?
She say “I thought you got sober”
And I say “I wish you’d stop being a bitch
And get to minding your business”
Told me “Money has changed you”
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?
How’d I get so egotistical? I’m a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I’m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up
(Fuck you)
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up
(Fuck you)
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye (Fuck you)
I've been a sinner, I’m just tryna stay
Warm through the winter, and I’ll be on my way
I’m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Uhm, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night / weekend
/ I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed”

[Part 2: God Speed]

[Verse]
Oh yeah
I thought I’d have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sitting on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we’d put her in a cab by now
But I’m stressing, I can’t relax
Swallowin' my pride and I’m hiding what’s making me mad
Everybody saying I need rehab
'Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long until they watching me crash
And they don’t wanna see that
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they could have done more to help me and she’d just be
Crying saying that she’d do anything to have me back
All the nights I’m losing sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbing them dark times
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up, admit it’s a problem
I need to wake up before one morning I don’t wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I’m too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain’t already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there’s a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don’t got horns, every hero ain’t got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, good morning
Yeah, good morning

[Interlude: Outro]
Yo Vin, it’s the morning, you gotta go to work
“alright”
Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
(You good?)
“I’m straight, yo what’s good?” (When you going?)
You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
“man, fuck that shit, I’ll skip”
You 'bout to go to work?
“Mmm”
Aight, what time you gotta be at work?
“I don’t know…. soon”
You Democrat or Republican?
“Uhh…I don’t know anymore”
Would you vote for a female president?
“I don’t care what gender or race you are”",eastcoast

Drink liquor like water, getting drunk too much, haan

Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask a question, um, have you,  have you
Have you been in love, before?

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you, I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you, through sunshine or rain
I love you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids, autopilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power
Swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me

And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one
When I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention
I want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy (moan)
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen
Look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting, yeah

Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah

How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now

From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump (jump)
Do you think that I can fly, fly?",eastcoast

Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, beneath a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturing the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die, but will you take me back?
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious
She's naked underneath them shadows
Let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though
I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep
It's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back back in his private quarters (private quarters)
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order (no)
All this torture, thought I had to warn you
Leave it all behind and go to California
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling
You can't fathom (Can't)

[Bridge: Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon]
My hands are ahead the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder looking down
While you're running around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead
You're always running ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you battle like a champion, why
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival
You got angels weeping, we can see them dripping from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye (so so)
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival (to the festival)
To the festival (to the festival)
To the festival (to the festival)
Festival (to the festival)
Festival (to the festival)

Hola, Malcolm
Hey man, it's Luis man
I'm calling, man, to tell you about the album
I listened, it's good
I need to tell you, man
I tell everyone to listen to the music
And it sound like they like it, man
It sound like it good. I tell my wife ""I'm so proud of him.""
I tell my girlfriend ""I'm so proud of him.""
And the album is good

Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (sex)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Um, well, baby
You were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""All you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loveliness bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh",eastcoast

But my heart like gold, but it break like glass

Well, you can't go away girl, I'mma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy league school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
Starting up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
To keep on holding on to your trust
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Just I've been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was; man I'm broke
But now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be

Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are
Yes we are sweet babe
And I can see, I can see, so much better
I can see
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever
Oh, loving me, in spite of me
Bless your heart, bless your heart
I can breathe, I can breathe so much better, yeah
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Okay, well you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay

Open your legs

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar + Delusional Thomas (Mac Miller)]
Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty, have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care (pleasure, pleasure...)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (pleasure, pleasure...)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

[Verse 1: Mac Miller + Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah and a freak mind is divine so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs, I eat up
Why do, why do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man that bitch so cold, man that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You're the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before
I need you more than keys need doors
I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm
Yeah and I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Beamer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I need to feel your touch
You shy, you don't reveal too much
No lies, don't hide yourself at all
With you, I just can't help but fall
It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you're, my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl you so lonely, will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

[Outro]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy"" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...

So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.",eastcoast
