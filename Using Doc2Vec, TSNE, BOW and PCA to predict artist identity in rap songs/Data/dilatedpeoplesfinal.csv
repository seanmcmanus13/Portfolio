Dilated, it’s Dilated forever, don’t get it twisted...Let’s Go!
[Scratch Hook]
“Your pleasure...Dilated Peoples”
“It’s the longest waited, the most anticipated.”
“The Release Party!”
“It’s L.A’s finest, Dilated Peoples.”
“The Release Party!”
“Get it right, we ain’t never left
We’re still here...you’re rocking with the best.”
“The Release Party...Dilated!”

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Butterfingers, they’re fumbling, killing us at the cylinder
Devilish how they deal, the selfish, the sinister
Sniping from the Avalon--you can hold this
Heart pumping ice water, they don’t know what cold is
This is show biz: more like pimp and ho biz
Hit the stroll, get the dough (Act like you know, bitch!)
Darkest before the dawn, lights out the darkness
The story’s old: ‘The plight of the artist.’
Wipe the sleep from my eyes, I must of dozed off
Jump back on my feet (Stretch!) Brush my clothes off
Send the invitations out, we celebrating now
Contract fulfilled, y’all, Dilated breaking out

[Evidence Speaking]
A record deal, is just a key to a door, that opens up a lot of bullshit, OK?
Right now, live and direct ,with Dilated to the people, direct, with no middleman right here
So we are independent and we are off our label
And we are celebrating that

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 2: Evidence]
I went from wrong side of the tracks
To encores back to back in two cities
Third show tonight, headed for a hat trick on stage
This year, there’s no fucking with me
Spit witty, Babu, Hit me!
The way my crew cuts, it looks like Britney
Cut O’s and split the, profit
Burn big, my eyes may get misty
Release toxins, I get boxed in
‘Dilated’s Dead?’: Not an option
Not a small glimpse, or chance or thought in
The back of my head, rumors of death, y’all lost it
The greatest show on earth
And when we in Houston at the dome it’s the greatest show on turf
Catch the screening, the old building leanin
It’s the tower, when the shit falls I watch it falls
[Outro]
We are no longer signed to a major record company, OK...(Cheers)
No labels, OK. Make some Noise...We are fuckin done!
“We are free..we are free...Free at last, Free at last, thank God Almighty we are free at last.”

[Rakaa Speaking/Scratch hook]
We not changing that shit, man. We ain’t going no where
Don’t get it twisted, don’t get it fucked up...Big up my man C-Sick in the place to be
Weatherman...Crown of Thorns...Duck Season Three!
Still rocking with the best y’all, it’s the release party
We celebrating this shit right here...it’s no tears, it’s no tears...
[Evidence Speaking]
Point the camera at the crowd...check it out!
Y’all motherfuckers are on our new DVD, so put your hand up in the air!",westcoast

Dilated, it’s Dilated forever, don’t get it twisted...Let’s Go!
[Scratch Hook]
“Your pleasure...Dilated Peoples”
“It’s the longest waited, the most anticipated.”
“The Release Party!”
“It’s L.A’s finest, Dilated Peoples.”
“The Release Party!”
“Get it right, we ain’t never left
We’re still here...you’re rocking with the best.”
“The Release Party...Dilated!”

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Butterfingers, they’re fumbling, killing us at the cylinder
Devilish how they deal, the selfish, the sinister
Sniping from the Avalon--you can hold this
Heart pumping ice water, they don’t know what cold is
This is show biz: more like pimp and ho biz
Hit the stroll, get the dough (Act like you know, bitch!)
Darkest before the dawn, lights out the darkness
The story’s old: ‘The plight of the artist.’
Wipe the sleep from my eyes, I must of dozed off
Jump back on my feet (Stretch!) Brush my clothes off
Send the invitations out, we celebrating now
Contract fulfilled, y’all, Dilated breaking out

[Evidence Speaking]
A record deal, is just a key to a door, that opens up a lot of bullshit, OK?
Right now, live and direct ,with Dilated to the people, direct, with no middleman right here
So we are independent and we are off our label
And we are celebrating that

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 2: Evidence]
I went from wrong side of the tracks
To encores back to back in two cities
Third show tonight, headed for a hat trick on stage
This year, there’s no fucking with me
Spit witty, Babu, Hit me!
The way my crew cuts, it looks like Britney
Cut O’s and split the, profit
Burn big, my eyes may get misty
Release toxins, I get boxed in
‘Dilated’s Dead?’: Not an option
Not a small glimpse, or chance or thought in
The back of my head, rumors of death, y’all lost it
The greatest show on earth
And when we in Houston at the dome it’s the greatest show on turf
Catch the screening, the old building leanin
It’s the tower, when the shit falls I watch it falls
[Outro]
We are no longer signed to a major record company, OK...(Cheers)
No labels, OK. Make some Noise...We are fuckin done!
“We are free..we are free...Free at last, Free at last, thank God Almighty we are free at last.”

[Rakaa Speaking/Scratch hook]
We not changing that shit, man. We ain’t going no where
Don’t get it twisted, don’t get it fucked up...Big up my man C-Sick in the place to be
Weatherman...Crown of Thorns...Duck Season Three!
Still rocking with the best y’all, it’s the release party
We celebrating this shit right here...it’s no tears, it’s no tears...
[Evidence Speaking]
Point the camera at the crowd...check it out!
Y’all motherfuckers are on our new DVD, so put your hand up in the air!",westcoast

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Move, we don't lose, second place ain't my groove
Play to win even if I played the fool
How could I break 'em, I made the rules
Got tools, big fish, never swam in schools
Eye to hand coordination is on, never lose my cool
If you got beat down you didn't sue
That's the era that I'm from, it was double or none
Whether New York nights or days in Cali sun
I'm the best when it comes down to weathering the
Troublesome and the blaze go out 'til it's done
Co-signed by Alchemist, stamped by Babu
Executive Produced, yours truely, got loot
It's a new day, phones still tapped, watchin' the crew
They put out one of my joints and I still got two
Steps ahead, don't sleep just rest my head
Bless the dead, 'til the day we meet I'm through

{""Time is money, got no time to waste minutes""}
This ain't play time, we don't waste time
{""Time is money""}

[Verse 2: Iriscience]
My style's like crackhouse and how I hit on the street
But kinda like Trackhouse and how I live on the beat
I'm a Mid City miracle, moms glad I made it out
Them knuckleheaded streets to Jamaica out with David house
For the shock is forever shootin'
Strictly self defensin' for revolution
I know the temptation of retribution
And that circle of death's not the solution
But I got insurance, I can see another day
Don't make me pull the policy and put the love away
It's the R-A-K to the double-A
I hate a bitin' MC like I love L.A
They be activated, can't tell proof on how my mouth was runnin'
Then they heard the solo album's comin'
""Duck Seazon 3"" locked on, Weatherman watch storms
Cali King Rakaa with a crown but it got thorns

[Hook]
{""Y'all hear me?""}, {""I spit it clearly""}
{""Time is money, got no time to waste minutes""}
This ain't play time, we don't waste time
{""Time is money""}

[Verse 3: Alchemist]
I hear nothin', see nothin', feel nothin'
Still hungry, ribs is still touchin'
My chest, yes my blood is still rushin'
I'm near nothin', no one, I fear nothin'
I keep bustin', who bluffin', we stuff 'em
To the dirt, then roll up the earth then keep puffin'
Keep rollin', hold it down and keep holdin'
Position, fold up the grip then keep foldin'
Stay clickin', pen grippin', page flippin'
On stage kickin', nothin' but the straight business
(Business) Comin' out my face with it
Time is money, got no time to waste minutes
But still I sharpen these bars and stay fitted
Post up, stay on my pivot, I handle my business
Calculate, stay on my digits
Stick and move, I don't lay with them bitches

Yeah.. PMD, E-V
Mr. Evidence.. Aiyyo

[PMD]
From out the dark, a voice that you heard before
Not one to sell out, how did I remain this raw?
Cause my style's rugged, step past you amateurs
You little peons, you wanna aim at P? I aim at y'all
Get real, you know P, put the ""B"" in ball
I did it to death, back agin, you stuck in the store
C'mon, what's ya rap handle? Gimme a sec
Lemme think... nah! Never heard of y'all
You on your grind? You better grind some more
Check it, you on your hustle? You better hustle some more
I flex a rhyme on a rapper, then proceed to wreck
By breakin this mic in half, then put him in the yolk and snap his neck
When five-oh rolls, they say what's the M.O
Another rapper was hit, by Mr. Slow Flow
So who these dudes messin up? Show 'em the door
If you ain't spittin hardcore, then say no more

[Chorus: cuts by DJ Revolution]
""So much to say but I still flow slow""

[Evidence]
Uh, code name E-V, rappin fanatic (yea!)
'07 Slow Flow, blackout addict
Record mode, set the EQ to Dolby
Low-key? Nah, with PMD they can't hold me
All these sirens they drop on these songs are false alarms
I'm the perfect storm after the calm
Only few things for sure like my maker I'ma meet
And in my life I'ma eat ten spiders while I sleep (hahaha)
I mean, the game's fucked for starters
Radio's week (y'know?), we buyin music at Starbucks (wow)
We live lies but tryin to see heaven
Denial, no plane ever hit Trade Center 7 (Think about it)
Learned from vets and they ain't war heroes
They blue collar, drive in +Taxis+ like Deniro
Right now I'm on my J-O, issue payroll
Six figures, tryin to add another zero

[Chorus]

[Rakka Iriscience]
(Watch it!)
I used to be Ice-T ""Reckless"" (RECKLESS)
Wildin out until 3, then eat breakfast
Mid-City's finest, dreams precious
Hustle 'til I'm breathless (outta control!)
They say, ""Rakka, ease off the clutch and drive slow""
Rev pumps the brakes, I accelerate a live show (Go!)
The race is fair and square, the tortoise and hare
I don't just smoke trees, I put a forest in the air
I swing swords of steel, I'm hard to kill
Blessed with skill, never ever stress a deal (NO!)
Bringin big business corporate checks in still
+Strictly Business+ +Never Personal+ catchin feelings
The fame that brought dollars, the dollars that bought fame
+The Release Party+ celebrates the breaking of chains
Hip-hop to the WORLD from black and brown areas
I flow slow but CRACK them sound barriers
Mr. Slow Flow

[Chorus]

[PMD]
When five-oh roll, they say what's the M.O
Another rapper was hit, by Mr. Slow Flow

Yeah...
I'm a L.A. brawler, Gracie Academy hallway loiterer
More shows get my pre-orders up
Six deep, packed in a Ford Explorer
I toured the whole world but never been to Florida
They holdin my shit, all winter
By the time the shit drop, I done already been there
The game's fucked, a thousand soundalikes, it's sad
Hard to tell the difference like they fake Louis bags
I don't fuck with that industry flow
What I do fuck with, is that industry dough
BMI, EMI, gimme all that
A side deal with who? Why not, where I sign at?
I used to do unto others, this the difference
This year fuck with things in my best interest
This ain't the new, it's the old from way back
""Click it or Ticket,"" man they forcin us to stay strapped
Act like you know, right now if not ASAP
This way was different shit, I ain't afraid to face that
This time, made up my mind, on my grind
On some James Brown, it's the Big Payback

(Chorus: scratched 2X)
Four by four, eight by eight
Twenty by twenty bars I demonstrate

(Defari)
Still blastin away
Spit and put the cash away, passion to play
Mashin my way through this Babylon
Out the gate I get up, I'm the one to gamble on
Luxury lyrics I give free of charge
Yeah right - my daughters don't starve
Holdin me down, pride and truth
The immaculate Dilated Peoples crew
Four by four, eight by eight
Twenty by twenty bars I demonstrate
Beat this down the block and you'll be like G's
Movin on up like George and Louise
On the low, in the cut, all about my cheese
My folks, came up, in these L.A. streets
I knock, and I bump, like 8:15's
They lock, brothers up, for eight fifteens
Defari is a method of truth
If you wanna know proper etiquette in the booth
(uh-huh) Hey 'Ru is the bomb
Pure like sunshine, just one rhyme

(Chorus)
(Rakaa Iriscience)
I'm on that Richard Pryor, Bruce Lee, Muhammad Ali
Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, Salvador Dali
Now we rap Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou
Out the disco Xanadu, hip-hop for the streets
Now the beat swing numchuk style
I'm like Jim Kelly tellin sucker MC's duck down
Heavy artillery with the heavenly spittery
And third strike energy, rockin cleverly pitchin heat
Fernando Valenzuela, original slangster
Lost Angels, Atzlan to beautiful danger
Call my travel agent, have her arrange
South America, South Africa and Southeast Asia
Then back to Mid-City we stack and get busy
In fact, Drev's barbecuse and Hustle got 'gnac
The way I manhandle bully muscle the track
Thank God I never focused on hustlin CRACK!
It's Rakaa with that educated animal rap
I still fight back and question when they handin me scraps
In the fresh denim jacket with the sheepskin black
With the ""Rest in Peace, Rob One"" piece on the back, yeah

But ain't smoking no less (ha!)
(Back again) Yeah, reversin' any curses
Back to jumping in crowds, spilling drinks on chicks purses

Stay away and out of the federal state traps
(Yo, we back again!) Kinda like Bush and Blair

Heart beatin, pulse racin, but I keep the pace and
Train to be the best and beat the best by the Gracie
Grappler spectacular rapper sport of altercation
In self-defense we hem em up, a tailored alteration
We're firestarters, leaving stages up in flames
Then again we're firefighters, spraying at whatever's blazing
Crazy ways to express and pass information
Daily making the best of bad situations
We fight to win in whatever type of test we're facing
Hip-hop came while they were underestimating
Amazing grace how sweet the sound, that's what I was raised in
But then the crack and gangs flourished under Ronald Reagan
Life insurance for kids, undertakers waiting
Earth is purgatory, here between the pearly gates and Satan

[Hook]

I stay relevant
Only person I stand in the shadow of is Evidence
Last page, I left off a good look
This ain't the next chapter, it's a whole new book
About to steal the game, I'm a whole new crook
Baking up that fire, I'm a whole new cook
Get your whole shit took, Cali's back under the sun
So you can't hide, and you can't run
From the truth, some ain't convinced so they decide to try me
Like I give a fuck, we live from India.Arie
They got spies in cameras and trailers
We see em setting up though we on counter-surveillance
On to me, I'm on to you, it's no mystery
Better think fast though, the future just your history
It's where the plot thickens, regardless of wealth
Cause the worst person to run from's yourself

Continents wandered, the planet got smaller
New York at 8 o'clock then head to Cali by flight
We got two shows, one on each coast the same night

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Yeah, the same fight for crumbs is not new to me
The hood sick even with free shots immunity
We need black and brown unity

By the time the shit drop, I done already been there
The game's fucked, a thousand soundalikes, it's sad
Hard to tell the difference like they fake Louis bags
I don't fuck with that industry flow
What I do fuck with, is that industry dough
BMI, EMI, gimme all that
A side deal with who? Why not, where I sign at?
I used to do unto others, this the difference

Lost Angels, Atzlan to beautiful danger
Call my travel agent, have her arrange
South America, South Africa and Southeast Asia
Then back to Mid-City we stack and get busy
In fact, Drev's barbecuse and Hustle got 'gnac

Got so many various pros
Different ones from different area codes
Right about now, I'm focused on my 3-1-oh's
And addin three more oh's to any bill I hold
And any deal I close, like just finished escrow
So now they quick to flock, cause they heard I got a home
But I ain't on star maps, cause the cat ain't really blown

I heard the poor get buried in dirt
I tell people play to win so they're scared of my verse

People scared of success, people barely alert
People scared to get hurt, or embarassed to work

You gotta watch for these types (watch) they be plottin
Subliminally waitin for you to get gotten
From Lost Angels to the rotten Apple (L.A.)
Some get lost or caught by the shrapnel (N.Y.)
Shoot your mouth off, cause richochets, watch for that

Regroup myself, dust my shoulder off
We back once again then POOF we gone
I seen shit go down like Alc' almost die
Now I see why they say it's safer to fly
In the same breath, breathe life accept death
Until then 20/20, one of the best yet

[Rakaa Iriscience]
I've had experiences that were out of body
Cops still probably clocked me comin out of parties
I've seen scandalous verdicts make Los Angeles uprise
Black Tail bottoms and Cannabis Cup highs
Create to Devestate taught me how to bomb
From Radiotron, to the German autobahn
Trade money still different color and shade bills
20/20 wide awake y'all keep your eyes peeled

It's goin down.. not now but right now..
By now you know the sound.. (C'MON!)

Three eyes wide, I can still see Ali
Say I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Now I float like a brother's high, swing like a beast
I'm from Mid-City, when the bell rings I'm released
Hustlin fightin and eatin still bringin relief
To my people, if they're in your reach, each one teach
Runnin through so much grass my shoes need cleats
Got that ""vente vente"" pumpin through these streets

[Evidence]
Last LP was odd, the score's even at last
Now we got enough trees to make you take 4 and pass
Now we got enough in fact don't even pass that back
It's free weed on me, you can hold me to that
When you see me in the streets, it be for that 20/20
Better than diesel, better than kush, it ain't funny
But trust me this Cali, my block's best product
We so quick to cop, Dilated Peoples got 'em

Yo, first up, I stay updated
Stay in the zone, and no question, stay ""Dilated""
Understand, I exercise patience (right, right)
Respect my path, cause the road, these cats paved it (set it off)
Now that we've got that straight, it's time to move on
I don't train for sprints, I train for marathons
A long haul, we're built for this
It's proven, every year, more people cop our shit
The point I'm getting at, we're building an army
Couldn't thank 'em enough, for real, I feel strongly
Right now, we're parked in a comfortable spot
By 2004, we're out to own the whole lot (Out for the top!)
To settle for less, the short change
So we keep our heads with us, as there's more to gain
And with, war is pain, so we roll the dice
It's all for the love, but some pay the ultimate price (check it out y'all)

Yo, they go off when they go on
On and on, on and on (Evidence: Marathon)
Pace yourself so you can face yourself
Run hard, you really only race yourself

But we don't run from shit, we run to it
Might run over your shit or run through it

I crack my own tooth, man, rap's a tool
Just to spit, crowns will leave your head wrapped with jewels
Respect that, even if you don't respect that
Label politics are just a minor setback
As long as we're willing and the heart is still in it
In the marathon, the artists will win it
Even though they want me to bite my tongue
Where I'm comin' from it's like ""Fuck that, I'll still win it""
The long run separates the weak and strong one
Never underestimate how deep the songs run

Pace yourself so you can face yourself
Run hard, you really only race yourself, yo

I'm like Axel when they kill Mike for the bearer bonds
Driven to fight, livin' in the marathon
Some can't carry on, they're tired or feel ill

Sometimes, it's just spectators and gladiators
Same party, next year, haters congratulate us
To Buddy Princess and Jalen, congratulations
This year, there's less funerals than graduations

Standing ovations, Dilated blows up every venue
A new era, placed first, style pursuing

I see a ""Cold World"" like the GZA
It's a blizzard out here - you holdin', twist up
But don't sneak tobacco in my rizzla
I'm from where they jack cats for their turkish links
Swatch watches, Fila and (?)
They took Jordan 1 and 2's right off your feet
If you fought back and warranted you caught more beef
The '80s was so crazy, cats are still afraid
Of Daryl Gates, the chokehold, crack and gangs
I hustled but I made it through a crack in the game
While a lot of homies got trapped back in the day

Up before the sun, try to come home before the sun
Shit repeats, days turn to weeks

I was told the world gets colder
Colorado air is thin, sold-out in Boulder
Much more in control gettin' older

I'll introduce myself, check it out, ladies and gentlemen

Every time I touch the paper, it's murder he wrote
I'm from a real big city called watch where you go
A place you think you know only to find out you don't
Born in L.A. it's hard to get star struck
Born in L.A. so I always keep my guard up
Born in L.A. plus still where I stay
Everyday, cats like Julio G paved the way
Me crew's thick, all sharp, take a pick
All ready to spit or sit down and write a hit
We learned both from the best on both coasts
Couldn't stress enough all the times we've killed shows

Label here, label there, politics and bullshit
We rip, the mic's cocked back, a full clip
I don't preach I rap, I'm on stage, this ain't a pulpit

Wherever I fall, I make the category look good
26 years young when I wrote this down
My whole life ahead of me, I was known in my town
Things started to change and started to stretch
The farther away I went the closer to home I started to get

Some love or hate shit (I don't ask) It just happens
Either or, we came to get it started

It's never too hot just like open up the curtains

Blow the show and turn the party to a nightclub

I rap caffeine, next LP spit cocaine
After that we might clear the lane
Blackout come back and do this shit again

Yo
I kill ciphers

It ain't perfect, yet n' still the hood is ours
And it's worthy, good people here work hard
But the news really only shows crooks and stars
It holds you for commercials that talk you into buyin shit
I was taught to learn from life and learn from my environment
Rocka walks the street as the son of a preacher
Who's the son of a preacher with people tryin to reach ya
I visualize the rise and realize the falling
High as time flies I recognize the calling
Went from lavish life to savage life back to lavish life
But never average, might be caught like Christ for the sacrifice
I still roll up my trees
For ? I meditate to roll up my sleeves
We adjusting readjust
I said I touch the world and the world said

Now, it's do or die
Now or never, time to hit the street

Ride out with shit to prove
Everywhere we go they like:
It's a green light for you
Got lyrics about pleasure some about pain
From Southern Cali where they say it never rains
It's different things that make me count blessings
As we burn for our peeps that ain't here as we sing
Reach us
In God we trust no doubt that's a must
A hundred times see us but still catch the rush
And when we fly bless the sky
Let your mission unfold
You in the car we in the bus bless the road
How could I reach you if I wasn't real
Might have to go before you really studied the flow
And understand the deal
This year fuck before mad, loud and clear
You know that's the truth they can't

Reach us
Reach us
Say this cause I mean it from the heart
Reach us

What happened to me, nah what happened to you

The lack and the fools, the check for Cali dimes down to Georgia peaches
At our shows to book us, Cara lewis is how you reach us
Got ho's girls I see got queens
Got friends got enemies and in-betweens
Teachers are students, students are teachers
Low key or prestigious I reach you, you reach us
I see lines around the block in the snow it's cold now
I see people gettin hot when the shot is sold out
I see dime pieces fight to the front to rap along
To every word, word for word to every song

No questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
That hides the snakes of America
So they watch it, now I walk with caution
More careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
But I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
War is big biz, ask an economist
Speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
But cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
It's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
On drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
The villain trained by the hero for the killing
Now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
They might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
Just listen to the knowledge I give
If more than half the budget goes to military spending
Less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
And justice for all who are miserable

Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
This figure from head to toe
Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
You hoes ain't fucking with that
Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission
Trying to recondition your stilo
Lyrical nino
I sling rhymes like kilos
From here to Puerto Rico
One other sequel from the infamous unseen
Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine

Verse 3 (Mia X)

Cause she up to schemes
Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
Mia's right and left well known with the clout
To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
That's what this here be bout
So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
Too much to deal with
I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
But I sees nothing but dollars
Feminist power
My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her
Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4
How they still need a ladder to face this hoe
For sure, cause I be living for the drama

Check it out, you now rockin' with the best

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Basic mathematics, add shit, subtract shit
Me and the mic we got this animal attraction
Mid-city out to Manhattan, ain't nothin' fancy
Yellow cabs passing me by, I caught Delancey
Keep my team moving through lights, cameras, and action
Thoughts to ideas, designs to manufacturin'
Ev still Travolta, I'm still Samuel Jackson
Blastin', Live On Stage is where it happens
Step to the zones, spotlight on
The sights on, all eyes on
Turn the tables and the mics on
Fans slappin Rak and they scream out loud
This time I give it back and applaud the crowd

Say my name out of self-defense
Catch me on stage with B-Real off two blunts bent
(You?) You almost famous
We got groupies that call themselves band aids to keep their feelings painless
Nothing to lose, got only shit to gain this year
Out of control, cars with six gears
Flow for my peeps and peers
You know we takin' Live On Stage
To new levels this year (watch out)
Not here to chase fans
I'm here to rock for people who feel my band
Connect dots across the land

There are lessons not taught that kids'll still learn
And joints that's not hot but cats'll still burn
Pro Bowl selectors, primetime announcers
Fans and promoters, bartenders, and bouncers

[Verse 4: Evidence]
Throw a jab at these cats, quick to counter
Clockwork how precise the heist gets accounted
Takin' over, set the pace for new seasons
People questionin' my loyalty for no reason
Treason? Never back out on my team
Fuck fake expansion anthems, loose on the streets
As for beats, keep 'em sharper than cleavers for meat

Uh-huh, sharp
Ha yes y'all
Watch out
What what, uh
Uh, uh
Yeah, it's going down

[Verse 1: Evidence and Rakaa Iriscience]
We got tension in suspense, theme in variation
Train robbery panic, description of equation
I'm after the gold, and after that the platinum
You want what you don't have so far neither one's happened
But I was told by my peeps play your cards right
Spit hard, never look back, disregard hype
That goes for bad reviews, good reviews (uh-huh)
Any press, the news, I don't watch the tube, I watch for crews
""Triple Optic"" cockpit views
Bird's eye, catch the rhythm in the words I use
I've learned to burn pain for fuel
Everybody plays the fool sometimes, the other side of the game is cruel
I'm back to school, the master rules
Born in the church where the pastor rules (why?)
I embrace the task that give birth to tools
And keep the pressure on that turns earth to jewels

[Hook: Rakaa Iriscience and sample]
""How that sound?""
Yeah, Dilated we're correctly holding the crown, it's like this
""How that sound?""
C'mon, yeah
Dilated; we're correctly holding the crown
""How that sound?""

[Verse 2: Evidence]
On tracks, it's like boomerang
Sometimes you gotta let shit go to watch it come back
{*Babu scratch*} Evidence, presumed innocent
Move in silence, tracks covered, no fingerprints
Most are hit or miss, not what this is
Type on tour that might, hit your misses
Pack the bags, load up the pre-vo last year
We hit the road with Rage, Guru and Primo
Cypress, D'Angelo, shit's Jurassic (hey!)
Kweli and all top notch acts, keep it classic
Bill Graham presents, ""Live at the Fillmore""
And after the encore, they ask for more
Fuck the IRS, I roll with I-R-I-S
'Science the best, so don't test
Exotic, attack the wack a word of advice
I got it down so cold like ice from Jew Heights

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rakaa Iriscience]
Check your fusebox, my ""Cosmic Slop"" brings cops
Ghetto hip-hop that your city block rocks
Say what? I bust a ""U"" and come back (hey!)
Reach under my seat for that heat that blaze tracks
Face facts, you're facin poker faced cats
Dilated made our way through the maze, ""so take that!""
For boom bap rap brought some state of the art shit (hey!)
After two L's, I'm ""Cool"" like James Todd Smith
Made ya burn while the, tables turn
I teach but I'm ready willing able to learn
These cats trying to eat, I'm just trying to breathe
And trying to leave a legacy that you couldn't believe
Live from DND, peace to NY G's
Rakaa Cy Young on the M-I-C
Babs is clockwork, you could set your wristwatch
And the real backbone of hip-hop is disc jocks

Money that looks funny but never no fake money
Make money, money, but please don't waste money
We don't love money but we don't hate money

Yo, if you live day to day then you proabably live life
More than a cat who got a Benz, bank roll and a wife
Cause yo, I seen a lot of folks whose so-called success equals depress
And look up to broke peeps who hold mics now
Play the role, reverse and understand
Your friend with no dough might be closer to earth
Take the pressure off the weight and see how it equates
If you hold yourself back to make papes, get it straight

(Iriscience)
You can use cash for tools, to get parks and pools
Community centers, rec rooms and schools
Book money, off the books and food money
Rent money, electronic money and crew money
First thing, flippin over dollars, searching
For the eye in the chief corner stone in thirteen
Stay beyond hungry and thirsty, (""dilated"")
We're damn near starvin and we're dehydrated

No credit, everybody has to pay
Dope music, spittin everything from hash to yay
Watch the traffic or you're gonna bring crash this way
Then have 'em swingin at my door like Cassius Clay (no matter)
The game don't exist without roles and rules
But karma manifest as the golden rule
Rolled on wheels in the eighties, they would jack them fools
Flashin trucks and jewels, but not tuckin they truck jewels

(Evidence)
Yo, since last year I've accumulated more money
More big breaks, been dressy a little less bummy
But more headaches and more pain in my stomach
On top of that I got a lot of people actin funny
But dummies get exposed when your weapon's are chose
Power to spit out your mouth cold could leave a man fold
Yo, been to certain places where the term ""green"" don't mean shit
Cause money's blue and that's what it takes to pay rent

There's cats with twenty/twenty that'll never see money
To get the cash crop you have to plant seed money
Twelve inches spark, now accountants crunch digits

Drinkin Jose Cuervo like some spanish bandits
Make women panic when I tell 'em I'mma vanish
Don't take it personal, these are eight-one-eight antics
Hoes break your pockets like car mechanics
Every morning, I bow down and pray like a mantis
Most women can't stand this but I, ain't romantic
So that thought you can banish to the city of Atlantis
Me and Tash met this tan bitch, made a Likwid sandwich
I consume strictly green leaves like pandas
Dig through ice for my brew, like they dig for woolly mammoths
I'm volcanic up in bitches that look like Dorothy Dandridge
Your style is Major Damage, it's played out and ripped up
It needs a bandage, how do you manage? I can't stand it

Hops, barley, water, yeast, grain
Distillery - alcohol for the brain
So check it out, smoke fills the area
Drunk as fuck, launch off the aircraft carrier

You overdid it homes; you had too much to drink (cut it out)
This bout's set for twelve rounds of pain
Tequila limes and salt, these cats hard to hang

And C-walkin ain't just a dance or a joke
We stay in heavy rotation, coast to coast

Yo, it's hard to pass the bar, ask your lawyer
Likwid, pour it on y'all from California
Programmers, spray this on your play list

And turn pistols back to mics and start blastin 'em

Aiyyo CaTash'll slap the track with a open fist backhand
I crack fans with funk then burn rubber like the Gap Band
Batman can't walk through my hood, it's no love
Tash'll jack him for his cape and sport that shit to the club
Is it love or is it buzz, that got my thinkin patterns
Thinkin yo' bitch is mine that's why you see me winkin at her
She'll be drinkin at a tavern, out of a glass size 8
Likwid Crew and Dilated make that ass gyrate
While you ask I take, anything that I could lift
Your rapper's rappin like CaTash y'all DJ's rappin like Swift
I was born with a gift, you niggas used to average rappin
Your styles is old as fuck, that's why my clique start cabbage patchin
I do this for the beer, and for the ones that ain't here

You need attention? I send medical
Basically you're trying to harm me, you're crazy
Musically I'm blazin', Physically, I'm Gracie
Triangle choke ya
And what the fuck could have provoked ya?
We don't know each other kid, and I did not insult ya
Don't make me feed the fish, feed the trees, or feed the vultures
I don't know stones, I throw statues and sculptures
I block flows with strikes and strikes with blows
I slice flows with my mic at shows
I counterattack and turn the tables in an instant
Move out of range and step in to close distance
Resistance, relax with less friction
Leverage and technique bring chokes and submissions
You got heart, you plan to make it happen
But none of my family are chumps or never have been
Respect mine, protect myself at all times
Build twice next time before you cross the line
I guess this is what you call a turn of events
And the best offense is a good defense

Tattoos, learn two tricks
Only thing between me and the borders and the straight face
Answers to questions, full eye contact
This confrontation ain't physical, but still combat
Leave ya'self left with options to choose
The last line of defense of my crew, don't lose
Psychic, precise, right and exact for songs
Only time we've been wrong is when we thought we were wrong
The science are format's own conclusive, but peace first and war, last
These words are crucial
Conflict resolved, but to those that want to brawl
Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional
Also, dropping the ball ain't recommended
When life or death decisions are made within seconds
Of course we make the right ones, strategically through
Self defense, but not by myself, Babu

Near the intersection of Crenshaw and Wiltshire

Military personnel are mobilized and waiting orders
Despite the quiet and the deceptive calm, tension is still
Thick in the air after last night's concert and rebellion
The incident was allegedly sparked by police officers trying
To shut down a reportedly peaceful concert by hip-hop artists Dilated Peoples

Click-clack, pull my mic back, you like that
Journalists, we're journalists too, we could strike back
Hardcore reporters with orders from headquarters
Behind enemy lines, sidestepping the borders
Repressed caps, we bring it to you as it happens
The streets love my crew from music to rapping
Street commander slash beat expander
Here to fight the slander with the proper propaganda

The pen is mightier than the sword
Cause the pen gives the word sending swords to war
They twisted it when he pulled Mao Tse-Tung
And said political power comes from the barrel of a gun
The officer meets his fate, .44 by .38
It was a dirty deed, but that don't mean a dirty case
Witnesses against the state are shushed
Facts overlooked so the judge can throw the book
Perhaps for politicians with something to prove
In the city where they blew the roof off of M.O.V.E
Questions when answered leads to more questions
Why it take months to deliver a confession
The principles are the same even without the name
But I still say M-U-M-I-A
I have to fight, it could easily be me
But just being the thinker than speaking it freely
Although I use my brain before using a fist
Don't push it, wake up, refuse and resist

Melt my trees with heat. Guns the remedy
Do what I do? You might panic and call emergency

(Evidence)
Set your own standards. Not everybody can do what we do
We can't do what everybody else does. Alot of people get
Comfortable playing follow the leader. But if you want to
See change you need to be the leader to follow. Let's make it happen

(Evidence)
Panic. Abondoned ship, iceberg titanic
Time to steal fans from other groups they take for granted
The way we came up nothing was handed
So when we drop the mic its hot. Pick it up, you might get branded
Might not like your plane the way we land it
But get the job done and then some. So panic
And it ain't the last. Coming from the fast
High-tech shit so feel the blast
Catch the wordplay, hype sends the survey
Instead of stripclub chop meats Monday through Thursday
Friday through Sunday. Blown off the runway
Ev the Weatherman use words instead of gunplay
Perfect caintance, can't catch on radar
Speak the truth yo don't run with traitors
Equator hot. The artic cold
Everything between turns to green and gets sold

Ready to spit

We step it up, no doubt the times right
Sleep all day to wake up for night life

Start every verse with something to quote:
""The devil you know, is better than the devil you don't""
Last year attest, true colors where shown
Kings remained in chess on the board and life in thrones
Music catch the force of my mic
Thats why at night I be out postin' up my own snipes
For years I sat back, played the role, what for?
This here disc, hear us raw
Can't fake it anymore
Check it out: You now witness the scenes

Shit thumps, shine bright headlights xenon
They like laser beams drive fast things and tee off greens

(chorus)

You know these nights ain't gettin' any longer
Put your best out and fail
You never know, you might get stronger
I stood back a bit, take punchlines out raps, they more legitimate
Solidify our place in the game, pleasure with pain
Tropical flow: see sun but feel rain
Its easy to seclude yourself up in the mix
That's why its good to get out at night and holler at chicks
I take it back before studio racks
Before I understood the concept of separatin' tracks
Before...
Around the time my life when I swore
That the mic was a device not to be taken light

Chorus

Night life...
Graffiti artists get armed
Cans get shook, the walls get bombed
This is the time when shadow rocks get thrown
At your tinted car windows sound off the alarm
This is the time you execute your plan
While other people sleep, jewels get rammed
In get away vans exit off ramps
Smaller operations are shops bigger one camps
Rock knots in pocket pants
Got the advance, and back for my back end in hands
And things ain't always what they seem from a glance
But up close shit'll change your whole prespective
Shadows close in, you realize you ain't protected

Started off hardheaded, stuck in my ways
But things change and days turn to nights
And nights are cold if your people ain't right
My squad it straight, split up the cake in three ways
My partners down, I'm feeling the pain
And when we up, find us out trying to live
I got lots of love for my crew, that is

[Iriscience]
Old soul in the game
I grew up stressed out trying to hold in the pain
But kept my mind right, sketched the highlights
I enjoy life but fight for my rights
And your right to fight for yours
I fight through forked tongues and spikes and swords
The days of thunder, the nights of tours
Its dope to fight the illness that fight the cures

For the love of cats scrambling to beat the odds
Hustling and ducking in between the laws
For the love of my family, the streets are ours
For DJ's ripping these beats apart
We puff herb and spread love, like Peter Tosh
With magic, classic, we prove that shit

I'd rather swallow blood than pride
Between love and war is a thin line
It's a dangerous time
You better go for yours, cause I'm going for mine
I'm bout to chip in, no doubt before I leave the grind
Till then, it's plots how we gonna win
And how to turn your buds over to our next of kin
How your gonna stay focused to beat the game
And how your gonna see if you try to stop the bang

Even if you skateboardin, ride on
Some of these freestylers need to write on like my homie Tash

[Tash]
I got my write on late at night
Burst a verse until they flow right
My rhymes be action-packed, I wrote these lyrics to a strobe light
I'm Tashy, the flashy nigga jumpin out that fast shit
Your rhymes won't impress me if you said em doin backflips
I crack whips on phones, blow smoke out nose
Niggas peepin out the style, hoes peepin the clothes
A million flows off the slang, bizz-a-pow, bizz-a-bang
Likwit crew is in this bitch, my clique be off the chain
Rap off the brain while crackin champagne
Tash for president, you know my campaign
First things first to get ya'll niggas off the street
You get twenty-five years if you caught wit wack beats
You coulda came to Ev, you coulda came to Swift
That's why we Escaladin while ya'll niggas need a lift
So give me two secs while I crack this Beck's
And once I drop the mic, my nigga Rak is up next
And I'm out

[Iriscience]
And I'm in
I pick it up for everybody in the house that spins
My name is Rakaa, innovator of rhyme communication
Wit Data like Star Trek: The Next Generation
It's Dilation, fan appreciation
Connected nationwide, worldwide Likwidation
Cali hard-hitters, we bump like car fenders
(It's all cheers) We only get boo's from bartenders
Better be sure, aim high, we top gunnin
When we touch down, we hit the ground runnin
Feds pull strings and watch me like Truman
But I can't front, I Love L.A. like Randy Newman

[J-Ro]
To all the homies locked up writin home, write on c'mon

Do it for the people, Years In The Making

[Evidence]
Yo, my first verse, from '90 to '94
Mostly peepin cats' styles out and hittin the floor
A little bit, in '91 that's when we got down
Different sides of town, on the bus I made rounds
I was involved in graffiti heavily
My people were Self, Tau and Freck RIP
At night I heard beats next door by QD III
Inspiration, destiny, Ev producer/MC
Now at this point, my face wasn't known and unfamilar
And when you look how I do, most cats won't say they feel ya
So I was mostly, humbled by rejection
But in my heart, I knew my shit would always pass inspection
Correction, travel east and hit the inner section
Hip hop shop to rock, blow the spot wit Hex and Pen One
Also Iristyle, a cat who worked there
I said ""I wanna bust first"" he said ""It's all fair""
I went, he went, you can't beat em, join em
I said ""As a team in the game, we'll leave em maimed""
He agreed, so we did till '94
Till we had to change our name from the one we had before
Now at this point, we were five years in the making
Previously vain, graffiti oriented, breakin
From cops to shop owners, rack and paint, stealin sketch books
Mad vinyl, designs in corridors
Then it was mics, mixers, tracks, and greenbacks
Kingston, 12 gear and equipment on racks
Imagery Battlehymns
Whattup to Kendall, Swift, and Redman
Everyone who helped bounce checks, but not my plan (Sorry)
Business and friends, this was my first introduction
How foul it is when it comes to this biz
Of music, 1995 was mad confusin
'6 it cleared up, independent geared up
Peace to Ben, 'Fari, and Alchemist
Third Degree type heat, brought on Babu to complete the list
Dis the doors, more red but on tours
The territories come, blunts burn our damn floors
Since '98, shit's been lookin more bright
Work The Angles round the globe from Main Events at night
