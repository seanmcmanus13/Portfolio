Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OGs in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

[Chorus: Eminem & Knoc-turn'al]
'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes (The watcher)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us, now callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just having fun just watchin' it fly by (The watcher)

And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate

And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it; damn, bitches

You know I come quick, help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin' to hide it from your husband, but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him that new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin' it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's looking for ya, he's always trying to run ya
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin', girl, 'cause I just wanna

Fuck witchu on the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch?
You acting like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya!)

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Off the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money

What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit
Can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you
And that's just being real with you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth
And we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

[Hook: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!

A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back
(Right) Just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
Nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
""Whose throat is it?""
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream ""I just don't give a fuck"" and see who means it

Nigga, what? Fo' sho'!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Hell yeah, still Alwayz Into Somethin
Heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascoes—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air
That means we takin' over this year

I hang among hustlers, that slang and Hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
'Cause gangbangin' is the active, activity
Where I be livin', B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you
Slippin', without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas takin' out like chores
I meet whores on tours
Jeanie`s hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores
B on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools ""Retreat!"" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh yeah I scream on stars
That get loot then crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Get out your car son, that's how I came to bougie niggas
At Bar One, it's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sardo Numpsay
But God's my bulletproof, it's hard to shoot me, you hear?

Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies

Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free

But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back

Recognize this; peep game

[Verse 1: Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (until we threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got 'em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[Verse 2: King T]
I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick boom
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup, clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al & Kokane]
We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt 'cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Verse 5: Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane]
We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what you found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home, to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat (Get the fuck out of here)
Learn the player rules, this is how a player do
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin' tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin
I left her up in Dallas, Texas, ass down

[Verse 2: Hittman]
Naw ""ho"" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (Sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, ""Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""
Fool I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya
The prettier the grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (Say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (Beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin' with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'ma see you on the rebound (What what?) D.P. style

It's fuckin ackrite
Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

[Verse 1: Hittman]
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman.""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team.""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite

[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the huss, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you
