Yeahhhhh (hey!)
Hahaha, hey, hey, ha (all right)

Let's give it to 'em, baby (hey!)
Grand Hustle, nigga
Aye, man
They been waitin on this shit since ""What You Know,"" huh?
Yeahhhh, it's the King, bitch!
Aight, my nigga, the wait is over, nigga
Hey, hey!

[Verse: T.I.]
One for the money, two for the show dawg
Three for the niggas hatin on the low, y'all
Know a picture's worth a million words I'mma show y'all
Death before dishonor, family befo' all
Without the braids I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Minus the testimony; say it ain't so homie
Hey! Shorty like that, don't he?
World hopped off my jock, I got 'em right back on it
Ohh! Step back, brush myself off
Picked bid'ness back up right where I left off
I could show my dough, that other guy just talk
Hey where I live just as big as yo' projects dawg
AY! Ha ha, better check my swagger
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar
What I drive, how I dress, nigga let's just bet a
Hundred stacks on that, nigga I'm just, better
Hahahaha, somebody better tell 'em mayne
They swag owe my swag everythang
It's very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I think a Thank You card's in order, y'all oughta be
Havin y'all swag sendin mines an apology
A lot of little me's I see, got beef
But what's the possibilities? Stop seek, you not me
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated; don't see how half of you rappers made it
Say good-bye to the fame and fortune, c'est la vie
And what the game need with you nigga? They got me
I ride through the city, so clean, seat really low
Automo-bil-ey so, pretty but I'm illy though
No comparison, ain't a nigga mo', thorough than
This gangsta American flow, doper than heroin
King like Evelyn, Champagne mayne
So deranged and belligerent; right up there with Benjamin
Who? André 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK
Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and, Lupe
So fuck what you say, you welcome to ask who you may
Bet they say as of today I'm back on top like a toupee
Hey! All objections overruled, it's overdue
Both high, and sober too, I'm so high, up over you
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth
Ooh, so uncouth, nigga who want proof?
Must agree if shit I did can't no one undo
I stay on my, one-two, nigga who want to
Turn a brunch into a brawl, do what you gon' do
I'm why it's, hot as a bitch in here still, cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission dear
Think that was somethin, listen here",south

Rebel for the hell of it, hella rich
Never have to sell a brick again, must I tell a bitch again?
The bullshit I'm addressin', check, I'm on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game; I'm celibate
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto, with
One foot out and one foot in, intelligent as fellas get
Listen, let's settle this: be clear, I could fall back
Seven years, still it ain't no one ahead of me
Consider it a blessin' if you get to stand next to me
Five-star general, OG veteran
Caked like Entenmann's, blowin' that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily
Rap until you're 70, still ain't no catchin' me
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, Aunt Beverly
Be standin' on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air, so stuck up, arrogant
Ain't got long hot songs, best cherish it
Cool, when I drop mine; that's over, finito
You payin' for your foul like a free throw: BAOW!
Now, how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the TV?
Know I sold more mixtapes than your CD
You're waitin' on your big break, prayin' you could be me
You ain't made it far as D.C., on the low
I been all around the globe, like a God how they treat me
Broads hit they knees, eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open, just beggin' me to skeet-skeet
You in a deep sleep, stop dreamin'
I'm six albums in, for ten years, I been firing hot semen
The limelight's mine, I'm gleamin', beamin'
Ask why I say I'm King, bitch, I got my reasons

[Hook]
Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly (bing!)
All on my mind is to get more millies (what?)
Niggas talk shit, that's silly (HA!)
Shawty, he ain't about that really? (nah) Is he?
Nigga, I'm illy! Haha, haha, haha, hey
Aye, I run this city, clearly (BANKHEAD!)
Tell 'em get lost, I'm busy, really? Nigga, I'm illy

[Verse 2]
Where niggas get off? Piss off!
Me and mine ought to take time to pop a lid off
Shit, all over the whereabouts of me, is y'all
Sick in your fuckin' mind? You figuring I'ma fizzle
Never cooled off, Tip scorchin'
Minimal injury, though they wishing me maximum misfortune
Number one, hands down, flows paint portraits
Everybody thinks you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some Girl Next Door shit
A king of oneself,  30 mil' out the store quick
Of course, this case, lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate, still buyin' more shit
But Tip bankrupt, according to your sources
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the lobby to the rooftops
Officially: the hottest nigga rappin' since 2Pac
'Fore you rap 'bout me, best ask 'bout me
I'm out my fuckin' mind, need counselin'
Please don't doubt me, trust me, drama ain't nothin'
It's all fun and games 'til somebody start bustin'
'Member my discussion when rappers be battlin'
I find out about it, better get to skedaddlin'
Pack your family bags, move 'em out to Seattle and
We ever cross paths, you'll need ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous, so extravagant
Mandarin Oriental, worldwide travellin'
Hip-hop champion, for real though
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil ho, nigga, but still though

Aye, just remember I do this shit when I want to, nigga
It's me, nigga! (Zone One, homie!) Yeah, yeah

Hate the price of fame 'coz it cost too much (yeah boy)
And you lame niggas talk too much (yeah)
I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em (yeah boy)
I said I'm ready for whatever, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Even though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement
How I walk around, people starin' at amazement
And I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playin with it
They so judgmental, maybe they don't understand
If your life was in jeopardy e'ryday, is you tellin me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony?
Consider this at least, I got e'rybody sweatin me
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressin me, ain't nobody protectin me
I'm dealin with the pressure from my partner dyin next to me
No one's arrested, they comin for me eventually
This was all the things I was goin through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orlean niggas comin in the city
Killin all summer long, ain't nobody payin attention

[Bridge]
Now, is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuses aren't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

[Hook]
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real
Can't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much
Plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
I be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real

[Post-Hook]
For real, for real, ay, for real
I say, when e'rything settles, for real
Ay, for real, ay, for real
I say, when e'rything settles for real

[Interlude (over Post-Hook)]
Yeah, I know what you thinking
""First Michael Vick, now this, huh?""
Naw, not exactly
I tell you how this shit went down for real, dog

[Verse 2]
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, I admit it, I'm guilty
But understand, feel me, I was ridin filthy
'Coz niggas out there plottin, to rob me and kill me
500 thousand every year spent on security
And my future was bright, but now it's gettin blurry
'Coz niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely, God'll deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart, I forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons, asset to my community
Look at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity
Mentally, I was focused on not lettin history
Repeat itself, that’s why heat was kept in the vicinity
Yes, officially, I broke the law but not maliciously
Through all of the publicity, was anyone considerin
My position and the logic hid in my decision?
But they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period

[Bridge]
But is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision

For real, for real, ay, for real

Ay, I said listen, homeboy. You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I'm saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I'm sayin? Everybody's entitled to an opinion, you know what I'm sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one
But the fact of the matter remains: if you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't lived a day in my life, you ain't survive the shit I done survived, you ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboy—you can't muhfuckin' judge me, partner
I mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?
They said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?
Now, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?
Now, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner
Ay, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?

Wayne Bridges, what up? Let's go!

History in the makin'! (Momma I did it!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Man, I remember, 'fore I say that, wait, let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
Now, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was livin'
Sub-standard condition, still handling business
Still laughin' and trippin', still having the bitches
I'm rapping now, reminiscing, and goddamn it, we did it
From trappin', standin' & pitchin' with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splittin' it eight ways, flip it in eight days
Thought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yay', but most the paper we made
In all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine
Had big work to move, but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who woulda thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here? we develop such a sound down here
Been duplicated often, still, can only be found here
Only listen to Gs, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?
I'm too busy a player, steering niggas careers
Been talkin 'bout it for years, and now we finally here

True story!
Rest in peace, Wayne Bridges!

They say what goes up must come down, but I ain't reach my cruisin' altitude (nope!)
Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do?
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm 'bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, look out for me
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made, nappy-headed rich nigga!
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week, 'cause I
Work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart to
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef, so that bread, he get it
Put 'em all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends' credit (true!)
And now they witnessed all the glitz and the glamour
Catch us eatin' at Straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Ordering Singaporean lobster, celebrating coming from nothing
To winning Grammys, and rappers winning Oscars, yeah
And they say rappers shouldn't act, nah, suckers
We see Samuel L. Jackson, like, ""Wassup, motherfucker?!""

I know them haters don't stop plottin' and wishin' we fall
Cause I'm standin' on top lookin' down at it all
I know from down there to y'all, it seems like I got it all
Homie, I ain't get enough, we still tryin' to triple up
That's why we got StreetCred and Akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much, shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember sayin', ""Damn, if I could just get to a million plus""
And now I'm like, ""Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?""
Tripled that on my bond thanks to Biggs and Run
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become
All this shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma, just call her, I sold dope
And dropped out of school, seems that's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle, now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimums, but not when the judge sentence 'em
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?
Just from standin 'round wishin, huh?
And while you standing 'round lookin' dumb, I make it happen
Takin' action, over time, got damn good at it

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star

So good I swore you went to college
Hundred karat deposit, to vacations in the tropics
‘Cause e'rybody know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You need never ever gotta go to yo' wallet
Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And go in any store for any bag she want
And, no, she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that, yeah

I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it

Never have you seen in your lifetime
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
Facin' all kinda time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thang to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter, I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say, ""Even the greatest gotta suffer sometime""
So I huff and puff, rhymes, lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get-get-get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city long as TIP livin', nigga

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty

[Verse 2]
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail until 2027
Rather see me in the cell instead of this new McLaren
God will take you through Hell just to get you to Heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do is handle, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing's still far from optional, and
Yeah, they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty

[Verse 3]
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dude, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now, with my hands tied
They take shots, cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me, it was over-with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say, ""Goodnight, shawty""
So they could try to rhyme, act and look like shawty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like, shawty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith, then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)

Hey, hey
Hey what's happenin' e'erybody
I hope they get my good side
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that?
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
This goin' make a hell of a movie huh!

I guess I'm just here for your amusement

[Verse 1: T.I.]
The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it, will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me
Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar
Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V

[Verse 3: Usher]
See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Woking a nine to (five) would it be better, I mean honest
Would you care to gossip about me, not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
(Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film...
In' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Usher I completely concur
Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me
Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'

Ay, I been watching you awhile now
And I just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing?
Forget about them other guys now
I know you ain't going try and tell me that you shy now
I realize that your beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you ain't got no business wit'em anyway
Wit such a pretty face, big booty, little waist line
I wanna grind from behind to the baseline
Have a great time, pour yourself a shot girl
Chase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you probably use to dealing with them wannabes
But honestly I gotta say I'm who they wanna be
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?
I can guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind we can try'em tonight

I thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar
Park the car, turn into porn star

Yes, I love to hear about your interest
I gotta say your intellect got me impressed
See your panties through your dress like a silhouette
Patrãn got me thinkin sex, is you feeling that?
No disrespect though, a simple yes/no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go
Pull up to the crib, get you through the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes
Time tickin it's the end of the night
And you can leave wit your friend if you like
But I'm saying though
We can ride out, back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you ain't gonna want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gonna wanna try it out
A little more of this will loosen you up
What we can't do in the club, we can do in the truck

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey would ya, stay?
Could ya play wit it with your tongue just a little?
You're such a sexy individual, physical and mental
And if you sentimental
Shouldn't the rules bend a little
Let me start at the top, stop in the middle
Use a popsicle make shiver, giggle when it tickle
I can talk to you dirty if you like that
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you a grown woman not a little girl
You can blame it on the Patrãn or the champagne
But sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now

Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want
""I really hate his ass"", ""I don't like him either""
""We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him""
Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done
""If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns""
""And if he really done, and we really won""
""Any more ideas, (I got some) suggestions anyone?""
""How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites""
""Spread, vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write""

I'm King like my 3 year-old, Major like my youngest son
Got one named Domani, so you know what I'm gettin (guap)

And I pay a million dollars for Ferraris, retarded, huh?
Sorry bruh, been addicted to ballin since I started up
See ten hoes, get 'em all to fuck cause they know this dough stack tall as fuck
Nah, it ain't that I'm rich that they hate so much
Least I could do it, not rub it in niggas face so much
So I'm tryin now while I'm rhymin not to brag about the island
Or the crib in Hawaii where all the walls slide in
House is wide open, we could bring the outside in
I think you should hear about it, but fuck it I'll be quiet
I just spit it how I live it homie I don't be lyin
Would it make you feel better if I put my pockets on a diet?
If I made less money, started to dress bummy
Would the haters and the critics have more respect for me?
Should I downgrade the crib and the way I live?
Now how about I don't and we just say I did, nigga

Mr. West is in the building
Swagga on a hundred thousand, trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even gotta question?
Hermes, Pastelle, I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means it's permanent so I guess I should address it, huh?
My swagga is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
""Why ya so mad for it? Why ya gotta have it?""
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Na-na-na
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?

(No one on the corner)
Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans 'cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas lookin' feral when the girls say yes
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
In that all-blue Yankee, it's my graduation cap
It's Hova!
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hova!

I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream, ""Papi, no mas!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no mas
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagga like these four gods!
And when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than a swagga, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows, stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on a bullet, make you feel special

You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the birdplay
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spittin' certain purpose
If you ain't living what you kickin' then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lotta records, I respected and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

When I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came up from nothing, all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that
Right or wrong I'mma call it like I see it don't forget
That impossible is nothing your environments irrelavant
Just don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence
Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you
They don't dictate where your headed they remind you
The Time keep ticking let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking be aware of your positions
Be aware of the collisions and the potholes sitting
On the road that you travel on your life long mission
Just listen every day is like a snapshot taken
If you live you can learn to be patient

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All the places that I go
And I the things that I know
Through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You can't take away from me
Cuz life is like a slideshow

[Verse Two: T.I.]
As I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream look where I took that
Beginning on Bankhead then it spread out
Vision in my head all I had to was get it out
When I walked out of my house and looked at my street
All I seen was opportunity that led me to truency
I ain't really have a role model to infleunce me
Uncle Quinn in prison they say next it's going be you in it
As I juvenile caught cases so fluently
Look at my life and learn from it don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now
How much better life would of been if I'da slowed down
Maybe I'da been Kanye instead of seeing Gunplay
But God got a plan, I'll understand one day
But one day of life, like a snapshot taken
Just believe you can make it have faith be patient

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All the places that I go
And I the things that I know
Through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You can't take away from me
Cuz life is like a slideshow

[Bridge: John Legend]
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhhh~!
Looking back on my lifetime
See the slides go by, sometimes I wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when
Do you remember then

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All the places that I go
And I the things that I know

Hey... Say pimp, this to everybody stretched out behind the wall
Countin' days on their calendar...
Flippin' pages, month to month
Hey man... I don't give a damn 'bout how other folks treat you man
I just wanna let you know pimp
You ain't missin' nothin' homeboy
Real talk

[Chorus:]
I know the times seem long
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
On Everything

[Verse 1:]
My uncle did a decade
Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid
Like he never did a day
Hit the streets, nigga still in the same place they were
'fore we went in the chain gang
And doin' the same thing
'Cause the game go on, you only did two days in the joint
The day you get locked up and the day you go home
I know it feels like the world passin' you by
Like shit happenin' every day out there that you don't know 'bout
Everytime you call home your baby momma show out
And your partners don't even send you flicks from when they go out
But don't worry 'bout it or stress it, cause shawty know what?
The time'll do itself, all you gotta do is show up
Keep layin' down wakin' up
And thankin' the Lord
And 'fore you know it they gonna open the doors
True story, just prepare yourself for it
If you ain't got a plan what you need was a second chance
Shit, you gonna blow it!
Learn and visualize what you try to do
And do the time homeboy, don't let the time do you
They say the time just flew on the street
Hard to believe from me never but you'll see soon as you on the street

[Chorus:]
I know the times seem long
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

[Verse 2:]
Probably thinkin' it's easy for me to say from here in the booth
But they showed ya, they'd put me in there with you
Right now, locked down in the state of the fed, lay in the bed
Prayin' it's over and over as you say in your head
Yeah, next time I'm a be straight
Just count down to my release date... peace of cake
My nigga Kap right now, servin' a life sentence for a murder he committed
In self defense
And in such good spirits, shawty ain't even trippin
And I could be right in there with him, no bull shittin'
He on his ninth year now, just waitin' to get out
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about
'Cause it could still be worse for sho'
So you waitin' on me to lose ho, you got to kill me first
I talked to my nigga Big Meedge, had to tell him the
Streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
Had to let him know whenever he released
We hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then I tell him
Just nobody ever did it as big
It'll never be the same in this city again, closest
You'll get is me and Jeezy and them
So dog, if it seems like you left behind, ten steps
Behind, just know it only gets better with time

[Chorus:]
I know the times seem long
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin' homes

Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit
Man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic
Situation coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

And the prophecy read that one day, like the phoenix rose from the ashes, that a boy will be born unto a family in the slums! This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains, while fighting for survival in the streets, to become a great leader! And in time, that boy will grow to become... KING!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Time to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)
I welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge
Respected from East to West like he was running the mob
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God
I know you niggas is broke cause I know what you charge
Them niggas wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage
It's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari
You niggas ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry
Fuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley
Cause where he stay 10,012 feet not hardly
Now you see that we ain't able to compete, now are we?
And pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story
Of the A, where I stay niggas stay down for me
You want to play, have you gay niggas lay down for me
And get a order for killers to spray rounds for me
Competition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you bore me
You reppin the A horribly, must I say? More importantly

You betta lean back
Nigga the king back

The king back!
Nigga the king back
Shawty you seen that? (What happened, my nigga?)
Nigga the king back

[Interlude: T.I.]
Ay, man y'all niggas got me way too fucked up, you understand that?
What you need to do is homeboy
You need to go back and grab I'm Serious you know
You need to get familiar with Dope Boyz and see where
All these niggas got they style
See where that trap shit came from
Then you need to graduate to mothafucking In Da Streets Vol.1-3
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik, I got locked up for a second
Then grab Urban Legend and now to bring you up to speed

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
Wishing to be in positions that you found that I'm in
Since you niggas do what it say I'm world renowned than sign me
If Jay handled the clay and around the time
I delivered a bad day when 45's were firing
I care the least about police and the fireman siren
Ambulance ain't gon' stand a chance in reviving
DOA the meaning being deceased upon arriving
Paramedics yell clear and your flat line silent
You ain't ready for out here cause the lifestyle violent
You think you is, you must be living on Fantasy Island
Make us mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand
Hit my phone and got what left and drained the three while you following
You say you want to release and go to war with the finest
Need you be reminded? Want it with Your Highness?

[Hook: T.I.]

[Outro: T.I.]
Ay man I know y'all niggas still in the trap everyday
Still man I know y'all niggas don't see nothing but the projects nothing but grits
But listen, make no motherfucking mistake man
I still wiil shoot up my motherfucking self, AK and
45 nigga on side nigga
And come see 'bout niggas you understand
But I don't want to do that cause I respect that shit y'all doing

What you know about that?
Ay, don't you know I got key by the three
When I chirp shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey I know all about that
Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at?
Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey I know all about that

[Verse 2]
Candy on the six four, leather guts and fish bowl
Fifty on my pinky ring just to make my fist glow
Your bitches get low because I get dough
So what I'm rich ho? I'll still pull a kick do'
What you talking shit for, you gotta run and get four
Got you yelling and I thought you pull out a gun hit four
But you's a scary dude believed by very few
Just keep it very cool or we will bury you
See all that attitude's unnecessary dude
You never carry tools, not even square, he cube
You got these people fooled, who see me on the tube
Whatever try the crew, they'll see you on the news

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Ay, don't you know I got key by the three

Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey I know all about that

[Verse 3]
Fresh off the jet to the block, burning rubber with the top popped
My partners busting shots, I tell em ""stop, it make the block hot""
Yo label got got cuz you are not hot
I got the top spot and it will not stop
A video or not that will bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
Although we not y'all, if it may pop off
I'll answer the question ""Will I get your block knocked off?""
This what it is bro, look, I will kill bro
I'm in your hood if you a gangsta what you hid for
Somebody better get bro before he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for

[Chorus]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
What you know about that?

What you know about that?
Ay, don't you know I got key by the three

What's happenin', man? This TIP, you know?
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin?
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son
And his wife, he lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin' folk
And I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin' joke
I can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch him, I'ma kill him, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not with me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he at his family house, let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments, he still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?
Well, that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru
Found out the hard way, that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heron, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap, with carryin' this here cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize, you died, that's why they say that

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Til you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot?
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
""But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' with that?""
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Outro: T.I. & Jamie Foxx]
Hey man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man
I miss the shit out you, my nigga
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy Jay-Ru
Jamar Hendrix, what's happenin'?
Also my partner Bankhead, Man Lee Horton, what it is, nigga
P$C for life, and death
And my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy
That's real talk man
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
Let me live in the sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
Why can't we live in the sky?

Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?

Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?

Everyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they're stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multi-million dollar shit, money is the object
Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond, Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch I‘m 'bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream 'bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house

Go, get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, Get It - Stay about my business

I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

Got your partners and the broad in your car fucked up
What, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow
Move 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road
On the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow

I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up

I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist
A lot of glamour and glitz, but shawty I don't need it
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'm a son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab, flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and got it poppin' like some bubblegum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nuttin but a young
Buck, niggas say, ""What?"", then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts change a old nigga whole face up
Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They'll try you once, 'til you pull a .40, then tell 'em shawty don't play wit' us
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care 'bout catchin' no case, bruh
Don't consider me, not statistically, another nigga it's too late for
Hey, wait, bruh, bet any nigga came from that?
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that

Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction
I'm a livin' legend.. no stuntin', no reppin'
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected
I'mma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation there""
Betta ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the King, or in Detroit in the snow
I'm a pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low

Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggas' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggas shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggas' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggas out here
Talking 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talking 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!

Just get her to the crib and get her whole back sore

Ask anybody wanna take a shot, I will
Might see me in a different color drop, Hot Wheel
With the top down low, and the Glock concealed
I got the Hayabusa racing up the block, one wheel
If the police try to chase me you know they a done deal
I got skills, anybody wanna come test
We'll send this .45 be up in yo chest

Nevermind those outside, when they stare
Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare
Because of one guy, you decided to share
As long as you having the time of your life, who cares
Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center
I know God see the heart, and I'm a stand up nigga
You can't beat me cause you ain't man enough nigga
I look him in the eye and tell him man up nigga

Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up nigga
Let the Smith and Wesson hammer body slam fuck niggas
Go and kick it with the hoes and throw ya hands up with 'em

[Verse 3]
You ain't know me cause I live so special
Try to stay low key but it's still so special
Flat screens in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser
Jewelry box glowing like I loan on treasure
I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather
Told her ""Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure""
Told her if she got a homegirl go tell her
That I got a hard rug, I could go for-ever
If Vanessa wanna touch it just let her
If she laughed out loud, I'll be shocked if we jus met her
Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth
And it's four pills left, do you wanna come with?

I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes

Open up for Daddy Kane and Eazy at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life, yo I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested

Governor),214880,30,79,King,1,True,15,2006-03-27,T.I.,0.508,0.806,8,-4.519,1,0.376,0.479,0,0.145,0.541,168.264,4,"The music of Louisiana is one of the most varied in this collection of Songs of the South, and consists of Country, Creole, Zydeco, Cajun, New Orleans Jazz, New Orleans Blues, Swamp Rock and Swamp Blues.  We're going to roam pretty far afield from country music, but stay with me on this; it's an amazing range of music to find packed into just one state. As they say in New Orleans, ""En ce qui concerne les gens , la nourriture et la musique , la variété est le piment de la vie."" (When it comes to people, food and music, variety is the spice of life."") So ""laissez le bon ton roulet"". (Let the good times roll.)


Songs About Louisiana
One of the oldest songs about the state is ""Lakes of Pontchartrain"", a folk song from around the time of the War of 1812. Not nearly so old, but a song that tells a story from Louisiana's early statehood is Johnny Horton's ""Battle of New Orleans"". Perhaps the most famous song associated with the state is by two-time Governor of Louisiana, Jimmie Davis, who wrote and recorded ""You Are My Sunshine"", one of the official state songs.

Other famous songs about the state include Randy Newman's ""Louisiana 1927"", Leon Russell's ""Jambalaya (on the Bayou)"", although old-timers prefer the Hank Williams Sr. version, Hank Williams Jr's ""Cajun Baby"", Mel McDaniel's ""Louisiana Saturday Night"", and Doug Kershaw's ""Calling Baton Rouge"".

Some of the most famous rock songs about Louisiana are from Creedence Clearwater Revival. While the band isn't from Louisiana, they sure sounded like it. Two that fit this collection are ""Proud Mary"" and ""Born on the Bayou"". The Animals' version of the traditional folk song, ""House of the Rising Sun"" is certainly well known. Lucinda Williams' ""Cresent City"" and Sonny Landreth's ""Back to Bayaou Teche"" may be less well known, but are equally good, as is this  version of ""Lady Marmalada"" by Christina Auguilera, Pink, Lil' Kim and Mya.

Songs About New Orleans
Starting with songs that celebrate Mardi Gras, Dr. John's ""Goin' Back to New Orleans"", the Preservation Hall Jazz Band's  ""Tootie Ma"", a brass band version of Jelly Roll Morton's ""New Orleans Blues"", Fats Domino's ""The Fat Man"" and Louis Armstrong's ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" will give you a taste of what New Orleans jazz is all about. But the list gets even more eclectic. Fats Domino does it in R&B with ""Walkin' to New Orleans"", and Them does it in blues with the Big Joe Williams' song, ""Baby, Please Don't Go"". Finally, Sonny Landreth sums-up the spirit of New Orleans with ""Levee Town"".

Hurricane Katrina and it's aftermath exposed the terrible response of FEMA and the true politics of the Bush Administration. Those attitudes get skewered in Bruce Springsteen's cover of ""How Can a Poor Man Stand such Times and Live?"", Bob Dylan's variation on the Memphis Minnie song ""The Levee's Gonna Break"" and Steve Earle's ""This City"".

Country Music
Country Music in Louisiana is heavily influenced by Cajun and blues music. It's played on the fiddle, guitar and other string instruments, and like it's influencers, It's bold and expressive.  Representative of the Louisiana Country sound is Lucinda Williams' ""Louisiana Man"", Jerry Reed's ""Amos Moses"", Sammy Kershaw's ""Third Rate Romance"", George Strait's ""Adalida"", Mary Chapin Carpenter's ""Down at the Twist and Shout"", and Black Water Bride's ""Over You"".

Creole Music
The Creole fiddle arrived in South Louisiana in the 17th century, coming ashore with French-speaking Africans from Saint-Domingue. The performance of Creole fiddle takes a lot of its cues from the African banjo.  The 1950s brought Zydeco to the forefront, with its big accordion sound, eclipsing Creole music. But Creole lives on in the homes and small clubs of Louisiana, and some argue it's a better representation of its original than present day Zydeco. Some great Creole music can be heard in
Cedric Watson's ""La Vieille Chanson De Mardi Gras"" and in the legendary Canray Fontenot's ""Les Barres De La Prison"".

Zydeco Music
Zydeco developed in southwest Louisiana by French Creole speakers, and blends blues with R&B. Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers were the first to have their music recorded in 1929 with ""It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo"".  Zydeco is sometimes described as polka music, but that's really just the accordion. If you listen closely, what you'll hear is the blues. Performances rely on the back beat, with modern bands adding a double-kick bass drum to emphasize the syncopation. The accordion almost always plays some blues licks, and the guitars echo that. Listen to Boozoo Chavis hit a groove with ""Uncle Bud"", and Clifton Chenier sing ""Tu Le Ton Son Ton"" and  ""Ay Tete Fee"".

Cajun Music
Cajun music is one of the oldest forms of music in Louisiana. The French people who settled in Acadia, Nova Scotia, brought with them the music rooted in medieval France.  After their expulsion by the British in 1755, many of them migrated to southern Louisiana. There, these ""Acadians"" encountered and intermarried with other ethnic groups, fostering their evolution into ""the Cajuns"".  By the late 19th century, they adopted the accordion into their music. While it fell out of favor for a while in in the first half of the 20th century, it came back in 1964 when Dewey Balfa performed at the Newport Folk festival. Cajun music has enjoyed growing popularity since then, and is represented by Doug Kersahaw, with ""Louisiana Man"", Dewey Balfa with ""Jai Ete Au Bal"", and the Lost Bayou Ramblers with ""Blue Moon Special"". But no discussion of Cajun would fail to mention ""Jole Blon"". It's practically the Cajun national anthem. The version here is by Waylon Jennings.

New Orleans Jazz
New Orleans Jazz is itself an amalgamation of styles that come from a long musical tradition in New Orleans. You'll find an excellent presentation of it's history right here. For now, give a listen to Louis Armstrong playing ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", the Preservation Hall Jazz Band perform a version of  ""Tailgate Ramble"", John Boutte sing ""Foot of Canal Street"",  and Nina Simone sing ""Little Liza Jane"".

New Orleans Blues
One of the oldest is the traditional ""St. James Infirmary Blues"", but the New Orleans blues style didn't really get started until after WW2.  It's influenced by New Orleans jazz and Caribbean music, and it's generally upbeat with a faster tempo than swamp blues. You'll find examples in Professor Longhair's ""Walk Your Blues Away"", Johnny Copeland's ""Devil's Hand"" and Dr. John's ""I'm Gonna Go Fishing"".

Swamp Blues
Evolving from the delta blues, swamp blues developed first in  Baton Rouge during the 1950s. It uses a slower tempo and is influenced by cajun music. It's recognizable in songs like
Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Suzie Q"", Tina Turner's ""Bayou Song"", Lazy Lester's ""I'm a Man"", Lucinda Williams' ""Can't Let Go"" and Tony Joe White's ""Polk Salad Annie"".

Swamp Rock
Some people claim that swamp rock begins and ends with CCR, but you'll find examples in The Meters' ""Fire on the Bayou"", Little Feat's ""Hamburger Midnight"", as well as CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle"".

Louisiana Artists
Here's a list of artists native to the state and those who spent enough time in the state to claim it as their home.  It's long, but it's far from comprehensive. Think of this as a primer. You can find the complete list of members of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame right here. The list includes one - three songs for each artist to give you a sense of their music.

Grand Hustle Pimp..
Hey, whats happenin shorty
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were goin to run this shit man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole nother side of Atlanta
A nother bunch of motherfuckers in the trap, y'all didn't know

[Hook]
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

[T.I.]
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering ""Jump"" on ya tube
They was still gettin jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm coming for you
So keep shit talking like it's something to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
I been hustlin since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering ""Pocket Full of Stones"" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was baggin blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had alot of work, alot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncle's point man is saying ""a chip off the old block""
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block

[Hook]

I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me and YoungBloodz
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
Nigga, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into serving keys when KC was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beef
I took my songs to street
He told me dopeboy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me

[Hook]

This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico at the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
The Snowman, Paul Wall, and Thugga, now say I was lyin'
Alot of other niggas shouldn't of even been signed
Thats a opinion of mine
Because these niggas be neglecting the grind
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'mma go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cuz TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these niggas mind, man don't get me to lyin
I seen ya kind, dopeboy, and that ain't even ya kind
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya tryin
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him survivin

You see, 'cause see I ain't been a fuck nigga never
I'm just warnin' all you sucka niggas
Better watch what you say to me
'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta a molehill
You don't wanna get your folk killed
Then watch what you say to me

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Got a tool in my pocket and the club just rockin'
Watchin' e'ry nigga while they girlfriend jockin'
They gotta let it go because niggas already know
That I got that thang with me and they just gon' let it go
I'm tryna mind my business though
'Til I hear this nigga say yo
""They ain't nobody, fuck 'em!""
I'm thinkin' I'm finna bust 'em
Wait, look up and see these police’s lookin' at me
I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell Jay Z
When you see him, surround him, then call to squirrel me
Pick a perfect spot and make sure that they girl see
My man offered dude a drink
He said: ""What? What you think?"" then coughed
From then on all you couldn't see nothin' but bottles
Remy Martin to the noggin, better bust it wide open
And his bitch standin' there
Hollerin' while he lyin' on the floor, shit
Why you feelin' sorry for him? He asked for it
Listen, y'all, here come the moral of the story

[Hook: T.I.]
Watch what you say to me
You see me and you know I'm tool'd up
You don't wanna see me cut the fool, bruh
Watch what you say to me
Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song
When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Rap music is somethin', ain't it?
The way these pictures is painted
You swear these niggas is dangerous
The gangsta shit they be sayin'
Lock 'em up in the booth with a half a ounce of that cannabis
Sit back, and watch the outlandish shit they portrayin'
But soon as you see 'em, they freeze up like in museums
Them statues, you like: ""Is that the dude
That said he was gonna… (pmmm!)""
Niggas get runnin' before you finish your sentence
And then they back to riffin'
When they off at the safe distance
You like, you was just here, you disappear like magicians
In thin air, I'm like damn, nigga, at least keep it consistent
I hear you baitin' me lately
I been doin' my best just to stay hater free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later I take you up on your offer
And put you all in your place like I'm replacin' your father
You talkin' to the author, the architect of The Blueprint
My DNA in your music—motherfucker, you stupid?

[Verse 3: T.I.]
'Cause I ain't never been a sucka
Been gangsta my whole life
So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight
I hear what you say in your song, some of that I don't like
Keep it up, I feel tried, I see you we gon' fight
Be a man, say my name if you talkin' to me
You never say it, well, I figure you ain't talkin' to me
Find out you is at the awards or was the code in the streets
I swear I beat yo' fuckin' ass like it oughta be beat
See, all that whisperin' is lame, I ain't one for the game
If I say fuck you, nigga, then fuck you, nigga, simple and plain
I say no problem, it's no problem, pimpin', you do the same
Now you just swallow your pride
'Cause you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from bein' violent but you come out your face
I got my lawyer paid up ready to catch me a case
When I feel you disrespected me, I'ma get me a K
But all this shit can be avoided one way

[Hook: T.I.]

Fuck niggas might talk loud, act real, but they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low, we know where ya family live
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive
Ya shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did
I ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is
I'll rest you case for ya real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got K's, half got Macs
Bring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at
We can do him right here, we could catch him in trap
Run up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat
With his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap
And dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that
Lights out, no hasta mañana, hasta la vista, sayonara
Y tú no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow
And the next one a y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man I'm really gon' snap

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Right now I'mma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg ""Please""
When a bullet wiz by, he'll probably feel a little breeze
Drop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome
Fifth triple grip handles in the squeeze
I keep a couple of those for the niggas who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and cop that ring
If you try to see me I'mma cock that thang
And I'mma pop that thang, and the shots gon' sting (really?)
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me
And tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew
Better people probably tell ya don't fuck with me
Front if want motherfucka you can catch it
Smile on my face even though I got a ratchet
Pop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it
Must I just remind y'all niggas when I come through
Know that I'mma find y'all niggas, take two (break through)
Bust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggas now (Okay, okay let's go)
See you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)
Then you better observe yo
Feel the sizzle from the bullet of the Glock burn slow (ssss)
Shit'll probably twist you up just a little and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down betta (lay down)
Checkin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt
I don't play bitch, you really need to go the other way

Ay, light hit my face sun brought the heat
Open my eyes see my car parked across the street
And then it hit me I ain't really slept at all in a week
Matter fact I don't even remember fallin asleep
Alantic office claimin J. Geter keep callin the heat
Is it an emergency or somethin you need to talk to me?
J said - ""I thought you needed to talk to me
If it's a change made aware I think it ought ta be
You makin ultimatums now you don't talk to me
You make shit way worse then it ought ta be
I ain't arguin on the phone, come talk to me
I'll be waitin on you dawg at the office, peace""
Now, thinkin hard as I walk out my house
What the fuck have I done now, what could he be talkin 'bout?
I been stayin outta trouble, shit I been on the couch
Just workin on the album, I was listenin now
Then, Doug called (ay you spoke to J?)
Yeah is it somethin I don't know that I was supposed to say?
All I know is for the hour I been woke today
Niggas comin with the riddles and the jokes today
I'm real close to J, I seen ups and downs hit
But I ain't never heard him sound the way that he sounded
Really caught a nigga by surprise, I was astounded
He a real cool dude but why he call me clownin?

[Doug Peterson] + (T.I)
You sayin you don't know 'bout it? (Know 'bout what?)
Atlantic Records said you called the office and went nuts
Makin death threats talkin loud gettin buck
(Man they said I did what? Folk I'm just gettin up!)
Say you waitin out your deal 'til you year is up
You plannin to make away with 20 million bucks
(You bullshittin me right? Is you serious bruh?)
Yeah they said from now on they'd rather deal with us
I talked to Craig, Jules and Kys' a long time
Long story short they said you done lost ya damn mind
And they runnin off deeper across ya deadline
You crossin a thin line, don't give 'em a deadline
Or they suin the shit up out ya, they don't give a shit about ya
Said you ain't doin nothin they couldn't have done without ya
Man you ain't never been hotter, worked a whole lotta
Years and came up to go way back to the bottom, what

[Repeat to fade]

It seems like everyone in the dope game now man
I told these niggas that it ain't gon stop
All the hatin' gon' stop or this thang gon' blah
Most of these niggas ,ain't slang ,no blocks
Got a lil' somethin', but it ain't so hot
Try to sell a record when my shit drop
Get the cover of the magazine

If you ever eye with a nigga this fly
You better watch your mouth
You ain't that high
KING OF THE SOUTH, you ain't that guy

To the fans and the critics
Think hip hop is missing
This is a lil' proof that hip hop livin'
You can hear a hip hop top now, just listen
Now see a hip hop walk out with 6 bitches
In the ATL, see hip hop chillin'
In a multimillion dollar crib hip hop building
You know how many cars hip hops driven?
Nigga I'm everything hip hop's missing
Nigga you is everything hip hop isn't
My heart and my soul, where hip hop live at
To anyone whos ever said hip hops finished
It can't be dead while I'm still livin in it

What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week bruh
These niggas can't keep up when they see me in London
Or out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for
Bout three days maybe, you see me in Haiti

I'm tryin to pick you up and never put ya ass back down
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin that around?
Here, pop one of these, now pass that around
Fire it up, take a shot, now ya ass in the clouds
Can I bend you over? Throw your ass back down
No need sayin no, we way past that now
I ain't them other niggas, just control the flashback now
Make three wishes, you can have that now
And fuck the financin, payin cash right now
Ay, miracle man make dreams come true
Take a ride, get high, 'bout the time you come to
I bet your life done changed, you likin my last name
Done had a couple babies with a Bentley and a Range
Crib on the water, eatin meals on a plane
And your life in the sky like you lived on a plane
With so much good shit to fill yo' brain
If the band seem strange I'm just sayin

[Hook]

[T.I.]
You see me, chillin out kickin back in the ride
With a, fly broad on the passenger side
Got a, nice smile and immaculate eyes
Before she, get inside she don't have to decide
Cause she can have it how she want it, we can do it like that
And then I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back
She said nobody never gave it to her like that
Hit it from the back, I figure you would like that
Her head and tight pussy good like that
And damn, she ain't even from the hood like that
So she probably never really kicked it with a cool nigga
Other niggas had her didn't know what to do with her
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure
Cause her waist real small but her ass way bigger
Hope she know that if I want her I ain't finna play wit her
All I gotta do is spend a day with her

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Hey, hey what it is pretty girl, would you like to
Come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two?
And you can take your clothes off if you like to
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you
I just do it shorty, I ain't gotta try to
Bust a move, bet ya I can satisfy you
And me chase right behind you, why boo?
I'm like you, know you fly but I'm fly too
You know how I do it, always ride good
Match the paint with the wheel, put the trunk in the hood
You dealin with a real nigga, get it understood
I'm still from the hood, even when in Hollywood
With my beat down low and my top let back
You lookin for a G, well you got just that
Hey I can be your king, you can be my princess
Baby all you gotta do is say yes

Pull up clean, then we hop on out
Snatch all the freaks, then walk on out
I'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not

You'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke
Aye, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)

Welcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball
Like you have no idea, the boy is here
Got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home
And just let 'em loose with the crayons?
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger
They hoppin' out of the way
Whenever they see Marshall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin'
But I'm bound to bump into somethin'
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'
The way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, ""Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends.""
""This is for the pimps
Listening to Mims, nail polish on the rims.""
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal

It's ironic that the shit that we poppin' makes us psychotic
Then treaten corporate America
That's why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant?
Look what hip-hop done brung us!
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest
For that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?

Ay Ay Ay Ay for as long as I remember
I've been telling you all man to pull these niggas resumes
You better check up on these niggas. these niggas be lying man
These niggas ain't really kicking this shit they be telling you all man
They wanna see you all get fucked up right there man
Keep your eyes on me nigga don't believe what these niggas tell you patna
(I'm tryna tell you partner)

[Hook:]
You niggas ain't cool what they rap about
These niggas ain't do
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true
You niggas ain't true
You niggas ain't really
Talking to 'em
Don't be no fool you better take you ass to school
Cause these niggas ain't G's
Gangsta's something these niggas can't be
What you expect these niggas ain't me
You niggas ain't rich
You niggas ain't really getting bricks
It's official man you niggas ain't shit
TELL 'EM I SAID THAT!

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
He nigga lying everytime you hear rhyming
He don't talk about they diamonds
And how they be out there shining
For the wrap
Hey were trapping
Tell you all they be at there grinding
And I know they ain't about that action
I'm telling you I'm gonna ride 'em
They probably try to come in the hood and sell weed
Think it's all good until they run into some real G's
Holla tell us where it is
And I promise we'll leave
Hesitate to saying boy them lamma well squeeze
Please pay attention to this part of the bull
One time got robbed got shot got shook
Got a job started rhyming came up with a hook
Got a chain and some tats came up with a look
Went and made a hit record
Talked tough in a book
Fuck the image and perception they never tough as they look
They some mother fucking suckers
Put it on whatever
Any real nigga know better man these niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
You can't tell
Them niggas ain't surely
Get caught with a nigga gon' tell
Them nigga don't sell
This you g ain't gotta put it on a scale
He ask you if it weigh enough just tell 'em YEAH
You nigga just yell
Pull the pistol them nigga gon bail
If he got a pistol bet he don't spray it
They don't wanna go to jail
And they ain't no hell be walking on shells
Gladiator school is you prepared
I can see these niggas scared
Gotta problem with me nigga just say it
We can play it how you want to play it
Better go head
40 pistols will be aimed at your head
All the way down and where your gold leg
You ain't really on the edge
You ain't really under suspicion of the feds
You just telling them you is instead
You never bought us head
But you get behind the mic and just say it
The people oughta know I must say it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You damn right
These niggas don't have rights
To rap about the shit I did every night
Did you win every fight
You ever went to jail for selling white
Made bond, back in the trap same night
Your know these niggas lame right
I'm speaking on it cause it ain't right
Nigga died I survived I done earned my stripe
Went to jail came home
Twenty times got it right
But still trying keep for shootin sucker niggas I don't like
Cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike
This sucker get a deal now he living so shy
You niggas outta sight acting hard lying on they record
Know it when you see recognize it don't respect it
Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city
Run up on 'em and try 'em but you see that they some bitches
Niggas tell you what they want you to hear
Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see

I'm down to die for it, absolutely mandatory
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle
Won't accept nuttin else so respect this hustle - AY!

[Verse One]
These niggas bitch-made, I'm gettin paid six ways
Six laid, shit's sprayed with lemonade with blades
Keep your mouth closed, you don't wanna get sprayed
Shoot you up your body, let it sunbathe six days
Kamikaze renegade, nah he never been afraid
Kept the trap hot enough to fry an egg in the shade
I ball 'til the day I'm lyin dead in the grave
I leave the Feds behind the wall cause I ain't get away
Chopper round the corner and a bushel with a brick of yay
A bust can happen any day, we out here trappin anyway
Gettin money's an addiction, damn what a nigga say?
I got a real bad condition if I ain't gettin paid
Hand over fist, well I miss it, gotta get busy
I know you see this car I drive and see the house that I live in
And figure this is enough (what nigga?) I want way mo'
Really this is Play-Doe, you set your sights way low
Had enough of the game, I don't know whether to stay or go
And different group of lames and suckas e'rywhere which way I go
(But nigga know you King, why you always gotta say it fo'?)
Cause they said I couldn't say it befo'
And I remember all it did was fuck my temper up mo', Doug and J know
I said I wear a crown, not a halo - sorry
Niggas think they seein me but they so sorry
They fast but they ain't no Ferrari {*YOOM!*}

Ay, don't you think you been pullin gats fussin cussin enough?
Round here braggin 'bout these niggas you be bustin enough
Man look around, ain't nobody sufferin but her
You could beat a hundred cases, catch one and you fucked
(Man I get probation) Is you crazy? Pull a gun in the club
See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
If we gotta come with a slug, why we come to the club?
How much more of this shit you think we can sweep under the rug?
(Look, we already told them ""I Told You So"")
But all these niggas speakin out who wouldn't spoke befo'
Don't take it personal, people wanna be close to folk
What you think the televisions and the posters fo'?
(Yeahhh man I'm claustrophobic though) Well you need to see a doctor for it
And I ain't jokin, you close Tip and you 'bout to blow it
Did you forgot about them nights in the cells, was you honest
(I dunno) When we was havin talks with God and you promised
If he made a way for you to be large, and you done it
Out the gate, ""Urban Legend"" went on to do numbers
Sold a mil', made ""ATL"", ""King"" first week five hundred
Won the Grammy's (but not the one that I wanted)
What about them eight figure deals and that other new money?
But ask yourself somethin, where the gun you got from me?
Keep it real

Talk about somethin other than yourself sometime (man)
Did you keep your promise partner? (Ay, just keep it real)

When your back was against the wall remember where could you go
Remember who helped you again like he helped you befo'
Went out they way to let you know that you ain't ever alone
They disrespect you, you come get who 'til they left you alone
He taught you, how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong
Taught you not to accept defeat, you go all out or be gone
Bet it ain't, the same in the streets now that he gone
He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong
Now he left millions devastated and his family mourned
Sons turn to grown men since they daddy been gone
Daughters grew, like him or not he left his family on
Even prepaid the funeral service he had in the dome
And there they came to represent, for a stand-up gent
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant
Impossible to stop him, had a head like cement
Maybe now you'll appreciate a nigga like this (they might)

[T.I. - over Hook]
Ain't gon' be no mo', remember me how I was baby
I can see you still laughin right now, HEY!
I made it possible homie
But I die for it, it's all good man
Strong got to lead the weak! Ay

[T.I.]
If they had only knew the man outside of the hype
No matter what the situation he always try to do right
Still they gossip to told lies, used to take him for granted
Often find it hard to relate, somehow they can't understand it
Cause that respect he gon' demand, if there's a problem he handle
Look adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge
They tried to knock him off balance when the Feds came and got him
Did the time on his head, came home, that ain't stop him
That's why them niggas used to hate him but they girl used to jock him
Swear he had the kind of swagger made the world stop and watch him
Plus he possess so much hustle made it impossible to top him
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop 'em
They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin possum
He used to scare them suckas shitless that's probably why them niggas shot him
And what it took ain't nothin else they ever could or did about it
So go on, talk shit about him, least you ain't forgot about him
I see

[Hook]

[T.I. - over Hook]
You'll see! Ain't no more of me man
Hey, hey, hey!
Enjoy, I did this man
That's how I just put the weight on my shoulders
I carry the load baby, I'm used to it
I'm built for it! AY!

Wanna say sorry to my momma, King and Lil' Mama
See me go through so much drama, you could stand a lil' thunder
Never let 'em see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber
Stay ready for whatever, make 'em know I'mma do wonders
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor
Showed you the sky was the limit, you could do whatever you wanna
That's for Bubba and Domani, Deyjah and Neek-Neek
Don't worry 'bout me, Uncle Phil and Leiah's with me
See me wit'cha granddaddy - I know you gon' miss daddy
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens
Hate I let a nigga kill me before I could quit rappin
And get to spend mo' time wit'cha, I know we'da been happy
But I had to take in them chances, you probably woulda been trappin

Там говоришь “грязь” – я говорю: ты не первый, друг
Я недоволен ремиксом, как Геттс от Скрю
Легче будет приложить револьвер к виску, чем тягаться с нами
Девки, вам лучше не лезть
Мы танцуем  - это эскимо дэнс
Мы стелимся пальцами здесь
Ну а если спускаем курок, ты взаправду мертвец
И ты запомнишь урок
Осталось недолго ждать, фам – идем к вам
Ты увидишь как орет зал – орет нам
Как мой брат берет майк и рвет в хлам
Ну а при нас любой топ съебет с глаз
Твою мать, сколько же вас здесь
Что приняли грайм-флоу за долбанный фаст все
Делают вид, что все в полном порядке
Но грязь флоу – наш ствол, чтобы перестрелять всех

[Куплет 2: I1]
Я много раз много кому кричал: “Рот свой закрой!
Ты не грязь, ты - неостывшее дерьмо с водой
Концентрированно врешь - ствол, нож, косой…
Но ты не МС, не вождь. Ты лишь лох простой
Дуй на работу, крась дом или окна мой - это все достойно
И почему ты из себя в треке корчишь воина?
Пацаны хотят знать. Не убегай, спокойно!”
Wagwan for that, my g?
Грязь - это время убирать МС
Они убираются перед мониторами
Настоящие в оптику мониторят их
Маленькое чмо их мониторит клип
Мне срать, что там миллионы их
Они - результат секса и алимонии
Все, что они могут - это забивать лимонники

Любишь эски бит? Грязь в твой дом
Любишь рейвы? Кид, грязь в твой дом
Ты с проблемами – грязь в твой дом

[Куплет 3: Tills]
Как всегда готов
Флоу тратила - сто тонн
На риддимы  и барзом поднимал гарь
Комнатный рэперок возомнил себя эмси
Тянется к майку - лучше присядь!
Баса волна - я Эдди Айкау
Ты гребаный даун, раз не выкупил стайл
Читал как Яни - забили камнями
Вот она грязь!
Нами движет инстинкт
Селекта вертит вилы как фрисби
У Gyal Dem намокли майки и джинсы
Мой блок - это весь мир
Когда я на средней скорости
Они на последней и выбились из сил
Примерил свой флоу в женском отделе
На лайве он лопнет, как мыльный пузырь

[Куплет 4: Redo]
Говоришь, что мастак
Так давай-ка проверим сейчас, что ты можешь здесь, дон
Я брошу риддим дроп
Твоя туса не поймет, что я делал здесь вновь (Бой)
Ты опоздал
Слышь, мой стиль так стреляет – Москва
Выглядит как будто я не покидал строй – what’s going on
Номер убийцы - Р Е Д О
Тебе не выкупить стафф мой за пачку красных
И не запачкав максы, иду с грязи вверх
Ты знаешь в чем успех?
Что записал вчера  - тебе приснится завтра

[Переход: Redo]
Skill from the ends – вот она грязь
Третий релоад  – вот она грязь
Boi in the corner – вот она грязь
Тебе закрыт  вход – так что завали пасть
Бой!

Флоу Йошумитцу - на любой из арен я убийца
Торпеды летят - нет, им не остановится
Нельзя взять моё - после не подавится
Я делаю madness - всему виной Лондон
Я sick в голове как и все мои Gangdem
You dunknow already when I’m on the mic все skunking
Стиль он холодный - доставай санки
Чтобы я не делал, я всегда иду in эти man там (kmt) dashed in the bin
Я направил на голову мой майк-карабин
Мои пули вылетают на коврах - Аладдин
Я делаю p’s я делаю грязь , ты делаешь флоп

Бадман эмси - это тот, кто?
Делает грязь – это то, что?
Цыпляет как кайф твой мозг
После это пробует твой бро
После него весь твой сквад
Эмси на рейве проливают последний пот
Зови это  - спорт
Русский грайм - ралли с [?] на износ
Это марш-бросок

[Переход: J Masta Badman]
Подушки от кросс
На голоеве капюшоны от кофт
Дъяволские взгляды из под козырьков
Потом воняет, убойной травой
Мошится вокруг сумасшедший народ
Флоу бьет в лоб
Словно гидропон через бонг прет
Прыгаю на риддим – это не Нью-Йорк
Но для него я Кинг-Конг, все также жесток

[Пред-припев: J Masta Badman]
Кто-кто-кто-кто

Кто-кто-кто-кто-кто даст тебе грайма и

Грайм-эмси слышит бит  - он обязан его убить
Давить на бис – это его перелетный инстинкт
Дай мне майк, отойди (Отойди)
Сейчас что-то рванет -  бум
Похуй, подвал или клуб
Раски гэнг тут как тут
На всех тренировочный look
Плечом к плечу, один к одному
Грайм, кэш, Брут
Пост напоминает бензопилу
Эмси за 40 секунд всем вокруг дает понять, что он крут

You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever
Anythang don't kill me, make me better
I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda
And the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't fo-ever
I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer
I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla
Even if I'mma all alone or standin' with four niggas
Tell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer
5'9"" with the soul of a 6'4"" nigga
I separated the fakes, paralized from the waist down
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town
Can't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down
I'm outta jail nigga, whachu gotta say now?

Sucka niggas can't make me suffer
Just make me stronger and make me tougher (It's motivation)

[Verse 2]
To be locked in a box niggas happy to see
Put anybody on top, any rapper but T-I-P
But back to reality, G-O-D still carrying me, nigga I run this
Spread yo rumours, kick all yo lil' dumb shit
Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon get
If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with
Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with
Small thang to a giant, I can overcome this
Jail, I don' done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with
I could be a local joker, never have one hit
Nigga, ""New Finish"" alone'll get me dumb rich
While these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies
If Grand Hustle sell any, I'mma get plenty
If God with me, who could be against me sucka?
Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher

I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood four feet
So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me
You gon make me bring this Chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin' wonder when it's gone cease
Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the FED's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'mma keep on flossin', poppin' long as Toomp is on the beat
Tell police's I ain't stoppin', I'mma keep it in the streets

See me and the P.$.C. fallin' through at a show deep
Police holdin' up the door, cuz they know we tote heat
I just wanna ride wit C, blow dro' in the Fleet
Or with Clay with bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill wit Kuntry and his daddy Freddie G
Ballin' out at anytime, at any store we spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas, courtesy of K.T
Mac Boney gotta mill, as well as Dolla D.P
A.K. house on the hill right next to J.G
Every week meet at Philant's restaurant and eat free
Get Inda paid, lil' Greg and B

I'm on my grind, Grand Hustle
Got the mind and the muscle
50 carats in the crown just to shine on you suckas
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'mma bust him
Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewelry
Get you niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hopped in a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the pen givin' stock tips
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat
5 carat stones with the platinum all up under dat
Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat
I'm aimin' at your fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of dat

A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map A-S-A-P
Ask anbody who runnin' a G, bet they finna say me A-S-A-P

A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map A-S-A-P

I know a lot of rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on Rice Street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'fore they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Feisty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Flip, say who known to the land and the people
My plan is to keep you at least 2, levels under me where I need you
I'mma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene white tees and Evisu
O.G. status, I don't beef unless I need to
Sissy you way outta line and you runnin' outta time
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time
Yeah I know you were thinkin' outa sight and outa mind
But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine
Listen nigga this shit here is more than just a lotta rhymes
I don't know what ya do for your respect, but I'mma die for mine

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespassed aganist us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
For ever and ever, hmm, amen

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I knelt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you wanna condemn
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' aganist them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Than you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you wanna
Compare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help

[Hook]
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man
Man, I'm prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else could see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me
They got me prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone, with no kinda support
While I was prayin' for help
Realized that I don't need nobody else
If God wit' me I can do it myself
I'm tired of just prayin' for help

[Verse 2]
I know it's only one king, one thing, one being
Only somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith
I pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day, that I'mma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight
I'mma be defending my strife
'Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never gon' quit
No matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever gon' spit, harder than niggas hatin' on Tip
You can take away, place it on Tip, I double my load
Carry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours
And I betta don't fold, put that on my soul
If it takes till I'm a hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ay it's so many times, I done wish I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed
With so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans
With so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggas in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests
So many haters love seeing you stress, but tribulations come with being the best
Still it's so many who flex, singin' bout checks, when they greener than Shreks
Sellin' dreams, never seen in the jects, that's why I'm seen as a threat
So many stripes off the streets I'mma vet, so many rappers get so little respect
Now niggas faith on the shelf, cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the heart that a nigga that dealt, so many niggas done left outta the hood
Made a way for themself, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self
So many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self
The ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help

Why you mad at me,Ay
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
Sucka ass nigga why you mad at me

[Verse 1]
Remember late nights earn stripes servin straight white
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the ""J"" need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Befo a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
Day right I'm recitein my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold sundays slow mondays hot friday nights
Tuesday thursdays servin whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggas had no idea what my life was like
Befo the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[Chorus]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I kept it pimpin and stayed down
Why you mad at me
Or is it cause I am the a town
Why you mad at me
Is cause you a lame and I'm a ""G""
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me
Is cause you know yo time runnin out
Why you mad at me
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south

[Verse 2]
Niggas mad cause I got it like this

Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a f**k about this industry
I'm a be the same tip til the end of me
Thats something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggas in to me
Got little rap niggas liking into me
Major lables and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't piture me
Ridein in a phatom and I swear I never favthom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from atlanta
Now I'm just tryin to maintain for atlanta
Befo niggas would say in atlanta
I was rhode park doug high stayed in atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in atlanta
But is that compared to contributions I made to atlanta

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky I ain't buckin like I used to do fool
While you was throwin one's and two's
I was liftin up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowin he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doin the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smellin blow I ain't sellin
Where you got that impressin ain't no tellin
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm sellin
I'm bankhead born and bankhead bread
And when a nigga die I'm gone be bankhead dead

In different colors mayne, worth a couple hundred grand
Damn mama, how you do that there?
How yo waist stay still but you move that there
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there
Check it, okay let's have some fun
I got four G's and 5 five G's in one

[Hook]
Ay shawty, bust it open for me
Let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose
No grey goose, if you don't get loose
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose
Bend it over, reach for yo toe, get loose
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose
No more dro unless you gonna get loose

[Verse 3: T.I.]
You ready to get loose, shawty, better be
Sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo feet on the concrete merely
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'mma let her be
Why should I let that worry me?
Too many bitches cherish me
Pimp til I die, be a playa til they burry me
Renegade, I'mma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches anyday
Slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex
Got yo girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X
Havin *Pussy Pumper*, so all them expect
The best sex, and that's what all of them get

Ay shawty, bust it open for me
Let me see you get loose
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose

You could up in the streets, but it ain't no gettin' out it
When I tell you I'mma G, pimp I'm really bein' modest
I could tell bout the dope boyz, hoes, and the ballers (ho)
The pimps and the macks, real niggas dat what they call us
Hangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us
??? on a Lac to a Benz on???
Standin' on the corner, slagin' crack and stackin' dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer
I ain't neva had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')
Tryin' ta get a meal fo my sons and my daughter
If I call a bad bitch wit connects down in Florida
Say her daddy and her uncle still get it across the water
Rich or not I'd be a motherfuckin' fool if I don't call her

[Hook]
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)

[Verse 2: B.G.]

If I don't know you then fuck ya
If I know you then I front ya (proper)
But you gotta break me off
You don't, I catch ya slippin' on the block and knock you off

Get 'em $5 sell 'em $10 a pill
I know people, get ki's for 13
If I fuck witcha, ya get 'em for 16
I know people, get 'em 300 a pound
Give 'em to ya for 500 if you my round
I'mma hustler, holla at me Uptown
I'm well connected with weed, white, slangin' dat brown
Come see a nigga want a nice 60

It's like dat, I done been thru the struggle
I'm runnin' Choppa City an fuckin' with Grand Hustle

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there
Or you can hear it from these niggas who was hardly there
Or take it from niggas who fought to make it a star to get here
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cuz I'm fact, dat's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'mma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'mma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shutin' down when the don appear

Diamonds in my bracelet shine like a Kodak flash
Just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass... freeze
All you niggas wanna touch my cash
The 40 cal's in the stash, and when I touch I blast
Televison's in the dash, suede roof in the coupe
I'm the one nigga, young niggas knew is the truth
And the dumb niggas I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
Yeah I'm rich, but I ain't just talkin' I live like this
You couldn't get water out the faucet as clear as my wrist

[Hook] {​Mannie Fresh & TIP}​
Pimpin' y'all ain't heard that latest?
Ay it's the best of the best
Young pimpin' on a record with Fresh
I drive Chevys, fuck Mercedes
Hopped out the new CL V12, got in the blue SS
And I'm leavin' witcha ladies
I got a beautiful bitch, pursuin' ya bitch
Next thing ya know, ya losin' ya bitch, pimp
Yall niggas give it up I'm the greatest
Ay, I'm the greatest, ay, I'm the greatest, ay
Pimpin' I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since you seen a nigga like me
In a pair of Gucci sneakers, jeans and a white tee
Extravagant and outa control, I might be
But I'm makin' 50k on the road a night G
Rocks in my ring, big as cubes in ya ice tea
I used to dream 'bout a Benz now I own like 3
I gotta wine-colored V, with the wine-colored V
And reclined leather seats, I ain't lyin' on my beats
You can tell I'm gettin' money how I shine in the streets
Blowin' on the best pine you can find in the streets
Rappers wastin' they time if they trying to compete
They records sales declinin' when mine hit the streets
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cus my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
You'll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
No matter whatcha do, you're 2 steps behind me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A smooth attitude enable me to ball outrageous
Nigga fuck you pay me, I'm all outa favors
What Grand Hustle got ain't a motherfucker gave us
A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us
You gotta mil' that's a small percentage
The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
I gotta Magnum with a magnum in it
Playstation and a plasma in it
Sittin' on 20 inches and it's tinted
Gotta hemi nothin' faster than it
The 50 Gs'll pass you in it, get real
Gotta Chevy more expensive than that Jag you rented
Excuse me, but let Young Pimpin' brag a minute
Gotta bottle of Louie and a flock of groupies hotter than Rudy
Lickin' me dry when I get out the jacuzzi
They eatin' pussy, suckin' dick until they mouth got gooey
Can't another young nigga in the south outdo me

T.I.P. shawty
Hey yo, this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
Get ya shit together come on
All the eight, nines, and dimes
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life
Ya understand that
All the stones is real
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know
Anything less is uncivilized

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Walked in the door, make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we don't approach them, they come and approach us
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down with the west finna go sho' nuff
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us
Hoes chill, poppin' pills blowin' dro no dust
What cha say, got a man so what
I don't know him baby and he don't know her
I got a new Phantom and my own chauffeur
Ya think ya finna be thinkin' 'bout him, no sir
Probably prefer to tell ya man good night
Unless you don't wanna know what the good life look like

[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]
[Lil' Kim]
If you ain't gettin' money good night
I know what a broke nigga look like
When ya ridin' in ya wheels get ya shit together
Boy them diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together

Now we can ball seven days, six nights
If tht head and that pussy hit right
Hey, match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In case you been researching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shawty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more

[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em' when they asked me ""What kind of diamonds are those""
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the ""Love Below"" ane watch'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to ""Get Low""
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya ""Let's Go""

(But she's a freak though)
She got angel eyes, wit the baby face
(But she's a freak though)
I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my name
(But she's a freak though)
They keep talking about you
Because they - can't keep up with your pace
You're my - super freak! super freak!
You're my - super freak!

[Verse - T.I.]
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Diggin deep, ol' nine up beside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a ho into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[Hook]

[Verse - T.I.]
The main thing making niggas judge you
Is the same thing that make me wanna love you
From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships that wasn't
But my partna say you trickin wit his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me wanna bring another kid in the world

[Hook]

[Verse - T.I.]
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me by the four, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I disrespect, she is selfish, she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question

Go get real spiffy mayne, go kick it with my broad, I'ma holla atchall later..

I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, whachu know about that?
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman & Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But then real close by, niggas better know that

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]
I ain't hangin' with my niggas, pullin' no triggaz
I'll be back to the trap, but for now
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today
I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster
I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 2]
This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's
With my hottie, takin' shots of ??? in the Hummer
Known to kick it like we riches, got Richie and Madonna
Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner
Check into the W, so I can put it on her
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger

[Chorus - repeat]

Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend
She the type to keep a nigga open
I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 3]
I left the stress in the streets and I'm a long way from home
Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone
My potnaz don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on mayne
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world
Just a bottle and this ?? dro, blowin' with my girl

You got a alligator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash
145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man
I spent my childhood in a wild hood
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G
You want to overthrow me

Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause they ain’t never seen a Carbine, a Mini 14, or a Tommy Gun
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga

Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder campy
Niggas is murder happy
12 years old, I jumped off the pot
I started selling rock right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down

[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]
Stand up
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up
If you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga

Went and bought an 8-ball, I was stayin' down ever since
That's why it's hard to find a young rap nigga better then

Pimp Squad mobster, Grand Hustle president
Heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant
""Trap Muzik"" heaven sent, you hatin' and it's evident
You tryna stack presidents, I'm tryna set precedents
The comparisons insultin' my intelligence
Cuz real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
And never will

Holla at ya where ya live, nigga fuck a record deal
Pimp graduated out the yay to stack a couple mil
Would you figure it'd be a rap nigga I'd have to kill?
My patnas tellin' me ""shawty ya have to chill""
But I'mma end up hatin' with the steel, watitis
Still Dope Boy, trap niggas worldwide lovin' me

Get it right, hold it tight, blast with all your might
See we hustle for them grams 'til the early light
Follow my plan, on command, leave them dead where they stand
Ain't no stoppin' the man, nigga with grands in my hand
Livin' the fast lane, Grand Hustle the grand when the cash came
The police book me, take my fingerprints and last name
Now I'm stuck in the cell, how would I maintain?
Loc up on these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame
I strive for perfection, my method is quite collective
Check out the fuckin' way I just rep it
It's Dogg Pound Gangsta in a black stinkin' Lincoln

This a trap
This ain't no album
This ain't no game
This a trap (trap muzik)
[Repeat 8x]

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Welcome back to the trap, niggas back in the trap
With another heavy Chevy, big dope boys and trap
All you rap niggas roll out, I trap when it's cold out
Wack niggas flyin but I stay down 'til I'm sold out
Cause down a hundred ground like a rapping in a dope house
Man wherever I be the feds got me scoped out
Motherfucker let my nuts hang, block out the duc canes
Cook it 'til it bubbles, double fast as a Mustang
I know you think you fuck man, but little shawty tuff man
Been a long time, since a nigga from Atlanta
Spit this much game that's a very few of real niggas
So how could they give nigga the feelin that a real nigga
Would get around a real nigga
All they do is steal niggas' ideas
And run wit' em holla somethin' similar
Talking bout the hood like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhythms, want em come get em
What bitch you pussy nigga, I'm just havin fun wit em

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Mac Boney]
Still telling niggas
I ain't holdin' I ain't foldin'
When the 12 hit the corner
I ain't rolling I ain't rolling
Keep the coke stretched out
Like Carl Lewis' hamstrings
Stepped on like I'm working
With the dance team
Triple beam ain't seen
What I do to a ounce of blow
The weight man on my pager
Like I pay you folks
To whip some more
I'm doper than the pure itself
I cook it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes
So they can turn to chef theyself
They love to work
Thats why I keep 'em comin'
Like collection plates
We flip the cake
We move this shit from Georgia
Baby state to state
Intimidate niggas in the city
Who've been moving weight
Yo pockets losing weight
They fuck with us
Cause you've been known to hate
Demonstrate the way we turned the drought
Out in '98, started out in '95
Started out with nicks and dimes
Niggas you done lost your mind
Thinking you could set up shop
Pimpin' I respect the game
Lets take this to another block

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
Pimp squad
Showty still in the trap
When the spot'll be hot
With the mayonnaise jar
And the collared green pot
On a lot of straight Hen
And a lot of green pot
Competition in a rage
Like he gotta be stop
Well maybe I will be
But probably not
Oh what the blood clot
You try to knock 'em out of he socks
Listen to I'm Serious thinkin' how did he not
End up way up on the top of the chart
That's because where I was
Man you gotta be pop
And if you really want to pop
And I rather be dropped
Listen pops
Want to know a little more about rap?
First rule if it's real
It ain't just a record deal

Huh, hell nah, I can't quit
Hell nah, man, we got too much money to be getting shot up
Stay down, Grand Hustle

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm this far from being a star and just that close to quitting
I never should've came close to missing
But I want to be a musician, pimping, not a politician
Listen, feel my position, it's a rough transition
Plus I'm way too deep in the game to be trying to change
For fortune and fame and glamour, I can be in the slammer
Or six feet up under Atlanta
It's a blessing to breathe
I walk the streets with seven felonies, I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing a G
T.I.P.'ll still be blessing CD's
So haters you can see these
Cause I'm back now with something to prove
Everything to gain, pimping, nothing to lose
I ought to start smacking niggas when it's nothing to do
They too big shoot them in the leg and even the odds
Cause you ain't hard unless you ran with Cap and C-Rod
Trapped with K.T. and robbed with J.R
Fucked hoes with D.P, broke bread with J.G
Switched labels like K.P
Who the fuck did all that, pimp?
Me, even though I'd rather go back to slanging drugs and shit
It's a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit
I can't quit

[Hook]
Even though polices hate, I'm legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
Hell nah, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it cause I'm fucking they bitches
Nah, pimping, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate cause they don't think I'm the King
Hell nah, I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating, start worrying then
Aye, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 2]
It's been ten years, an album, and two deals
For real, we all know I should have sold two mill, at least
It's all good though, I flow for the streets, I do it for y'all
Every weekend see who in the mall
Still in the trap signing your shirts, giving you dap
Kicking it with you then get you and your folk in the club
Posing for pictures with girls, give them kisses and hugs
Pouring out liquor at shows, passing niggas the dro
One of the realest rappers niggas'll know
But niggas be hating
To the point that they be calling the station (""Don't play his record"")
But they respect it cause I'm ready and focused
And I see they petty and bogus
I want you to know this but most of you know this
Niggas in the game ain't real
Got to stay selling records cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name will sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell
I can't quit

Even though polices hate, I'm legit
And rappers hate it, cause they know I'm the shit

They ain't hating start worrying then
Aye, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 3]
You can please some of the people, some of the time
With some of your rhymes
But they may not like one of the lines
I'll tell you what, I'll let you criticize me one at a time
Those of you who think I'm too cocky, get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like that when you say I'm tight, I say, ""I already know""
Don't like how I was talking shit before my album could blow
Thinking I need to calm it down be more like the average Joe
So, fuck you, them thoughts, and that little house you think I'm in
Get a Benz, I'll value your opinion then
Think I give a fuck how many time my record spin?
Fuck what you recommend, I'm back again! (Look, pimping)

Eventually, see I'm outta your range
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
I entertain young niggas who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain

Came in kissin' ass when I came to lead
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what tha fuck is fame to me?
I been plottin' since kindergarten, you'z a lame to me
I give the niggas what they came to see
A reflection of one self where they aim to be
As you can see it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yoself
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro smoked that, now I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga
Hate me, why?

I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high
It's never when or why; it's the way that he die
Did he stand like a man 'til the day that he die?
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
And if you running your mouth you can die in the slum
'Cause in the south where I'm from they dying for crumbs
You can die for your partners or die for your moms
Or you could die cause your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing
Or die in a plane—they say it's a bomb
When they run it into a tower—they just say it's Saddam
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building
With total disregard for all men women and children
See niggas get killed when people mix they money with feelings
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling

I was supplyin' the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand thats how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine

We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion
You hear us talking loud, just think of us as chameleons
Adapting to situations, but accusations of stealing
And burglarizing your house, I mean you just hurting my feelings
We got lives, we wanna live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are few, it's hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
When you're under 25, staying alive's hard work

And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help

With all due respect, we don't even be fucking with y'all (maan)
And we can't help it cause it is like this

And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Lightskinned... Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans

So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W-
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu wanna do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two

Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

I'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been dranking and I've been smoking
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
454 SS, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
Doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, ""Straight Outta Compton""
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering ""What's happening?"" kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
If your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'

I make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tigthest ride, I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'mma flip my keys
Been paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P
Broad busting, like a baby do a binky
Five karat DVS's on my mothafuckin' pinkie
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we dranking
Pimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique
They'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft
So y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang 'til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the

I'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now
I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin', talking ‘bout what you making: nothin’
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing

Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K

Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin'

Got a condo, in Orlando

Hoes be so crunk in the club
We gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P
They payin' just to peek in
When they leave
They be lookin in a car
They can't even see in

He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's

But he got a label now
Them boys, the PSC (hell)
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for
2 or 3 mill. (ay, shawty)

The respect of the niggas and G's
So next time you say them niggas is G's
You probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin'
Bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggas is hard

I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top

I'm well known in the hood
Like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man
But I shole wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em
And the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album
Never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck
Was jumpin' out the stores
Cause I was born in the raid
And I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days
In the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap
With the best in the streets
Shot craps in the back
You know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me
You best invest in some skis
I sell slopes of snow
I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (to what?)
To double up and bring it back
And make a little more (You movin' slow)
And movin slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'mma cock hammers and 44's
And nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggas know

I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime
Had my son and turned around and had another one
I broke yo heart when I told you bout the other one
I stay in trouble ha? Ain't got too much to lose
Knew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all
You think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
Just take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band

On the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'mma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, cuz hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now

How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express whachu deserve, girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same signs
Same goals, said thangs at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla ""Dat ain't mine""
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks
Not just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy panicked
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me

Forgive me babygirl, I apologize

Know I can't be your man why I feel like this
What I need with a woman when I live like this
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
Set times to the side just for us to live it up
Walking out of Ralph Lauren, purple label linen, yuh
It's hard for me to discuss what I had vision for us
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus
So what if I got a pass, labelled a dirt bag
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets
A part of the package, but still far from a marriage

Yea they gon get outta line, but dez niggas is scum
They outta sight and outta mind 'til you visit the slum, stay down
Stay on the grind and yo digits'll come, bottom line
You gotta shine no matta what you become
Dez streets is 40 percent of yo mind and 5 percent muscle
10 struggle, 10 time, and 35 percent hustle
And trust if dey don't burry the scared, dey burry the dead
When anticipatin pistol play, be very prepared
And if you ain't, find somewhere to burry yo head
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds
I said

[Hook]
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me
Ay be betta than me
Crack a slug nuttin betta to see then young niggas wit a felony sheet
So be betta than me
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way betta than me
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be betta than me

[Verse 3]
In a broke down Cadillac, ridin' high
Not many trusts in this life either shine or die
Ima live one of two ways, either grind or cry
And Ima grind it out, even if I'm dyin it out
Ain't got no mo than me, so what the fuck you lyin about
That man right there, but ain't gon be when dey start findin out
That that bullshit you be talkin ain't the real deal
That ain't you blow, them ain't yo cars so how you really live
See what you need to do is take a chilly-willy pill
Go and chill yo ass out, fo dey deal yo ass out
A bad hand from a mad man, in a mad clan
All dem otha niggas take a fall you gon take the last stand
Gnawed in, sawed in, how everybody ball
When everybody else is all in you don't know where to fall in?
Need some Flaw Henn, I'm telling you shawty
And don't be buyin none of dat bullshit sellin you shawty
And all that otha shit they talkin is irrelevant shawty
Tell 'em, show you the papa, fo dey show you the cable
You see a whole different nigga when you open dem drables
Follow hatas nuttin holy can saves us
Shawty be betta than me

[Hook]
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me
Ay be betta than me
Crack a slug nuttin betta to see then young niggas wit a felony sheet
So be betta than me
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way betta than me
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be betta than me

Aye, uh-uh, uh, aye
Aye, what's happenin'?
Ye-ye, ye-ye-yeah
That's right, one time for your mind
What's happening, pimp?
This for all my niggas who think they hard
Ok, nigga, I'll tell you what's hard, pimp
(What's hard pimp?)
Going about your day, nigga, losing your life at the end of it
Nigga, that's what's hard, nigga
(Minding my muthafuckin' business, that shit was fucked up)
Let me tell you a story about the last day I lived in my life
(How it happened, man?)

[Verse]
I'm in a '96 Impala with the gat in my lap
Annihilating any nigga trying to work in my trap
I have the feds got me tapped
So to keep 'em off of my back
I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax
Now my indictment was a secret, and that's the way that they keep it
If I ain't have a ho giving head to the feds coming back telling me exactly what they said
I'm a dead man walking
Waiting on time in jail
But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail
Long as I got another ounce to sell
What the hell, I'mma bail?
Grab my scale
Get another ki and I'mma slang my yayo
Everyday it feel like they on my trail
Look them in the face say, ""Fuck they jail""
Niggas on the westside can't re-up because it's a drought
So I check the crack house
Damn, it sold out
Now back to the crib, so I can check this stash
Ain't sure about how much dope I had
Got a couple kis in the safe right now
Weigh it up, cook it up, then chop it down
Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti
But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin my G's
And my keys to my brand new V, put 'em in pocket
So my gat–blue jeans, Desert Eag'
Nigga, you holler 'bout freeze
Put this red dot to your ass and squeeze
Now I'm dippin back to the SWAT
With the 4-4 and a plastic Glock
Turned around the corner and I had to stop
Couldn't trap, before me it was the cops
Sit and watch, but I still ain't scared
Mac Boney and 'em must have fled
Only cops is I fear is the feds
On my car flashing blue and red
Damn there they go, now it's time to dip
Got the 4-4 right my hip
9 millimeter with an extra clip
That's what you niggas get fucking 'round with TIP
Busting at 'em, and cussing at 'em, but ain't no shaking 'em
Them bullets that they was busting at me, my vest was taking 'em
Making them pigs fall in pain
Turned around cause one called my name
Took a hot one to the brain
Yeah, I died, but long live the game",south
