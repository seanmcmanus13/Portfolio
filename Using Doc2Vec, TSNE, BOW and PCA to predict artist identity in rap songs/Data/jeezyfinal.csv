S'posed to leave it in the pot until it's harder than some pavement
Fuck these niggas talkin', I've been ballin' for a century
Niggas think of quarter kis and scales when they mention me
Three point five, damn right, I had to grind it out
Graveyards and penitentiaries bars, I told them sign me up
Pops didn't wear no rubber, I was made for this shit (raw)
In the kitchen whippin' like a straight slave for this shit
Spill some liquor on my feet, I just paid for this shit

Now go get your bitch and get the fuck off my dick
You can be a lot of things but you'll never be this
Word to Stevie Wonder, bitch, you'll never see this
I went hard on them suckers, I served all of them cluckers
Niggas switched up sides, I don't fuck with none of them busters
Tried to fuck up my groove but I was already groovin'
Them bitches can't stop a train that's when it's already movin'
Look, I got a confession, I just bought a new .40
Hangin' out with the big ones, so we gone call this bitch shorty
One thing about shorty, we be up in that club
And if she feel that you hatin', well she gone show you some love
What I gotta lose? I ain't never had shit
Two hundred fifty one grams in this plastic
Now it's Avion and champagne, nigga on my rider
Ever in my city, you might see me in that Spyder

Outside the club killers with me with their favorite K
Damn that coupe sexy that's what ladies say
'Vette white, Mercedes gray
Pockets full of cash off my latest play
I've been getting money like I'm touring heavy state to state
Used to chop every last gram until I scrape the plate
Four niggas looking like we signed to major labels
Dining at Katanas twelve phones on the table
Buncha horses parked outside, the lot a stable
If you know us then you know this shit is not a fable
What you see is diamond chains on everybody's neck, everybody flexing
Hit the club and everybody sweat and everybody's stressed
Niggas talking big shit boy go do better
What you copping man we pass that out as testers, this forever

They say he talkin', I'm around, he never speakin' tho
Just pull up on these niggas, that's they weakness, bro
I meet the ho, beat the ho, then need a ho
She pressure, my necklace, is shinin', I'm special
My niggas, get money, no, we can't help you
I'm selfish, I'm greedy, not needy
I'm gangsta, on bloods, this money shit come easy
Lay up, neglect her, eject her
'Cause I don't do Rebeccas
The way you hop in my whip, I don't like your jester
You gotta have class the whole year, not a semester
Think before you speak, I got westside extras

Fell in love, must be, told her she the one I need

Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety

A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?

Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing

You know I went to sleep no stressing
And I woke up to a blessing
I got the whole city back guessing
""How in the hell she catch that blessing?""

Give em the game for free, I really should have charged a fee
All this killing in the streets
Black on black crime
Young men taking life, and you're putting em in your own hands
But let me give you a little game, and a little knowledge (chuckles)
You better pay close attention to this, right
The killing must stop
Y'all black mens, it's bigger than that

As soon as you get banged up, right?
You'll be down that joint, with two suit and a lock up
No green dots, no Visits
Your main bitch, you know where she be at, right?
Fucking your bottom nigga, your best nigga
So you better think
You think about what lives you're going to destroy
How many families you're gon' hurt

But guess what, you lose everything
Right before you go to sleep at night, you pray
You pray to God for a change
You gotta change
Free every nigga in the chain gang
Free my son
Free my family",south

In the back of my mind, in front of my brain
I’m a pretty good shot but this ain't my aim
Want to live the American dream like Uncle Haus and his wife
Work hard, feed my kids, see what that be like
For now I’m seeing junkies and pipes
Making sure a solider put a uniform on and go and earn him some stripes
See my counselor told me education or you starve
Last time I seen her she ain't even have a job
Gangbang, sell dope or rob
Welcome to the African American mob
When you probably gone die even less than your worth
Leave your momma with the bill a funeral home and a church

No mo' JOSE, no mo' ROSE'...
They locked my dog up and that ain't ro-zay..
All he wanted was the fame, make it last forever..
You get some one's, I get some one's
We make it rain together..
I'm talkin quabo dreams, cristal fetishes
Smokin' everyday, just to keep ya sanity
Just me and my nigga like 'WHAT UP DOE'...
Still partyin', the club closed an hour ago
I guess the back-to-back lambo's a thing of the past
We use to talk on a chirp, now we talkin' thru glass..
Just like the glass, I know he see's right thru me...
Transparent...I can't hide my window pain
Im thinkin' what to say to make him have a betta day
Im walkin' down this lil' hallway like 'what the fuck I'm gon say?'
As I'm walkin' down the halls I feel the stress in the walls
I need to lighten up, man...this shit is to tense
Feels like I need tums, my heart aches so bad
But when he see's my face, he's gon be so glad
Then I look into his eyes swear to God I seen his soul..
Tell me what can make a hot boy stare so cold?
As I looked a lil deeper, I saw a lil hope..
And then he cracked a smile, he still got his pride
Keep doin' what you doin', hold us real niggas down...
No matter what you do, dont let us real niggas down

I done been through so much, real life done lost touch
Inhale so much yayo I lost my sense of smell (haha)
And I don't mean that literally...but I mean this literally
These niggas actors, me I'mma factor..
Known for movin' big money, I should've leased a tractor
No brakes, no tires, I'mma ride for these streets..
YEAHHH..until the wheels fall off!
It's gon take more than hate to get my focus off
+Can't knock the hustle+, still stackin' +dead presidents+..
They say he's on his was out, well thats a +reasonable doubt+..
+Ain't no niggas like the one's I got+..

Call the the X man, keep a pocket full of pills
Image this, so much ice in the watch (How much?)

Welcome to my life yea the first episode
Never miss a beat I got a many time codes
Still count a quarter mill with my fuckin eyes closed
One hand behind my back and a fucking blindfold

Four shots in the chest, why niggas get at me?
They done fucked around and fucked up my new white tee
I'm just living my life, why they mad at me?
Woke up this morning, I ain't see this coming
Should I even bust back? You ain't see me running
I hope heaven got a V.I.P. lounge
Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door
You know I hate waiting in line
Paramedics on the way but they wasting they time
Everybody standing over, nigga's screaming and shit
Damn, ya'll give a nigga a second to think
Which one of you niggas shot me, it was one of you bastards
Bet my nigga Kink throw a hundred grand in my casket

But you know how it is, amen, god bless

My nigga on the west side owe me bout a dub
And my partner with a few, shit he owe a nigga too
I shoulda, hugged my son, shoulda kissed my mother
Spent some time with her, show her I love her
Every night she was praying for me, I was in the streets
Active little nigga, shit I stayed in some beef
Loochy going through some real shit and he really need me
And what about the streets? Shit they need me too
Almost forgot Def Jam, shit they owe a nigga too

We interrupt this program to bring you this breaking news story
I'm Kelly Washington reporting for WKKT, Channel 7
Witnesses say that around 1:45 this morning
Shots were fired outside of an Atlanta nightclub
Rapper Young Jeezy was involved in the shooting
But at this time it is unclear whether he was the suspect or the victim
We'll bring you further details as they become available
Back to you...back to you...back to you...
{Whoa...It's hard to believe he's a child}

I was, on my way, I was almost gone
I was almost there, I was almost home
On some Kanye shit, tryin to Touch the Sky
Jesus walks, God testify
I'm a Legend like John, we Ordinary People
You only get one life, there's no sequel
So you can't take nothing for granted
And don't take granted for nothing
So I gotta thank God for waking me up this morning
Ay, and giving me this air to breathe
Please Lord forgive me for every gram I sold
Every, Glock I popped, every rock I chucked

Born september 28 my life far from great
No food on the table so we fought for steak
But I'm so close to jail feels like I'm so close to hell
Moms smoking rocks same stuff im sellin
So who's wrong her or me
She addicted to the high im addicted to the cash
Almost put my hands on her when I caught her in my stash
How could I do her like that lord knows im wrong
Why would I do her like that lord know she strong
I know its been hard but we made it baby

Remember back when we shared our clothes
Look at us now we sell out shows I must be dreamin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I was young and dumb with a pocket full of cash
Posted on the block with a pocket full of glass
Full speed still running from my past
But its starting to catch up yeah its gaining on my ass
Theres 2 types of people predator n prey
I'm a predator I prey 3 times a day
A man once said one day you'll have kids
And how you goin to explain all that shit you did
I'm a soul survivor we far from a crook
She always said I was a lot smarter then I looked
So I took my dreams and made it some thousands
Then I took my life and I made it an album I must be dreamin'

When I done it you know I did it to death (death)
So sit back and hold ya breath (just hold ya breath)
I don't know about them
I really ran these streets
So listen up as shit get deep (Let's Go!)

[Verse 1]
You know I'm smoking the best
I ain't got to brag
The young fly nigga with the Georgia swag

So is the piping
The clientele in Minnesota
And so it the Vikings (Damn!)
Inside so soft
I can't believe it's not butter
Snowman bitch
Did I st-st-stutter? (Ha-Ha!)
Came straight from the hood
Right to the big screen
The way the boy ball
You'll swear he had hoop dreams (Yeah!)
No grants, no scholarships (nah)
Had to make my own way
I still stack them chips (Hey!)
The homey from the block
Coming down with the knowledge (knowledge)
Straight to the pros
Yeah I soared past college (Yeah!)

[Chorus:]
What you talkin' bout?
Nigga my life (Hey!)
And I'ma get it all
No matter the price (Ha-Ha!)
When I did it

And showing ya
Half these rappin' ass niggas is lames (Hey!)

You know I done it the best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, and just hold ya breath (Yeah!)

They say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the blacker the rims the sweeter the coupe (Whoo!)
That money goes out, that sack comes in
I can't even lie, I'd do it all again (Yeah!)

Just like the work (Hey!)
And it was snow white
Just like my shirt
Got in so much paper
Seen so many haters (nah)
Seen bricks stacked tall as skyscrapers (Damn!)
Got damn that's high (Yeah!)
Done everything I said
So I am that fly (That's Right!)
Everyone was the truth
Tell me who came realer (Huh?!)
The word on the street is that I'm still that nigga

[Verse 3]
Between love and hate
There's a thin ass line
I think we all can agree
Last summer was mine (Ha-Ha!)
And if you don't say my name
Then you wasting your time
And if I don't wear my watch
Then I'm wasting my shine (Yeah!)
Spend a hundred on it homey
Then set the time
A few mil before the deal
And I'm still on the grind
The critics criticize me
Cause a nigga talking yams
I ain't sugar coating shit
This is who I am (nah)
Nigga you been to the A
You seen me making it rain
Seen it wit ya own eyes
You know this shit ain't a game (Yeah!)
So you niggas listen closely
To what I'm saying (saying)

Pull it out my pants and make errbody back up
Fuck a record deal, the boy just too real
Watch him cook it on the stove, man the boy got skills
Streets is talkin, whole hood's whisperin
Careful what I say cause I know them folks listenin
It's your boy Mr. Seventeen-Five
My lil mamma hold the strap and the work while I drive
Take it out the wrap and I put it on the scale
But keep that on the low cause I ain't tryna go to jail

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
They call me Slick Manning cause my vision's great
Toss shells like pigskins when I squeeze the eight
Think I start for the Braves, way I rep the A
Like John Smoltz in his prime when I pitch the K
Got the scale in my pocket on a suicide grind
Yams in the strap facin suicide time
Outlandish wit it man, it's stupid how we shine
Catch me in them bunkers with them troops all the time
I eat like Saddam but I'm sick like Uday
Keeps some youngsters with me and they all bout gunplay
We been had the streets jammed up to stock
We down south niggas but the plugs up top

This for gangstas, I ain't talkin bout you busters
Chopper toters, money getters, naw not you suckers
Cooler than a fan, colder than a freezer
Still in the hood, ridin sixes on the Regal
Still on MLK, still got a side
Still get money and I'm still in the trap
Lil mamma say she like me plus she know I'm hood
I'm a fool with laying pipe, and she know I'm good
I got a spot for the yay, Uncle Pete keep the K's
Auntie Shirley got the money, if they rush then we straight

But I still bury a nigga
Put the mask on, Jim Carrey a nigga (Blaou)
Suede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin awkward
Careful with the sweets, dont burn my seats
You could live your whole life and not come close
Guess thats why these rap niggas take notes
Recite my adlibs, borrow my quotes
Make me IHOP a nigga, serve them with the toast

Wassup?
Hahaaa
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say ""Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?""
I told him ""Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty""
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go

[Verse 1]
I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth

[Hook]
""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I'm a hustler!""

[Verse 2]
Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds
Fresh out, right back chasin bread
My life's so hard, so concrete
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street
Take me for instance
My life is not about you, think me for instance
I did the impossible, I made it out
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on
Stuntin in traffic like ""This my car""
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things
Lovin every minute of it, still breakin chains

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your past is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have
Partly cloudy so I need a forecast
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin tell him
